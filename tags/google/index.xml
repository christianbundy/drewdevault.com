      <description>Microsoft infamously coined the euphemism &amp;ldquo;embrace, extend, extinguish&amp;rdquo; to describe their strategy for disrupting markets dominated by open standards. These days, Microsoft seems to have turned the other leaf, contributing to a huge amount of open source and supporting open standards, and is becoming a good citizen of the technology community. It&amp;rsquo;s time to turn our concerns to Google.
Google famously &amp;ldquo;embraced&amp;rdquo; email on April Fool&amp;rsquo;s day, 2004, which is of course based on an open standard and federates with the rest of the world.</description>

      <description>I used Google for a long time, but have waned myself off of it over the past few years, and I finally deleted my account a little over a month ago. I feel so much better about my privacy now that I&amp;rsquo;ve removed Google from the equation, and self hosting my things affords me a lot of flexibility and useful customizations.
