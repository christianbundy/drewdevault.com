      <description>Tim Bray&amp;rsquo;s excellent &amp;ldquo;Bye Amazon&amp;rdquo; post inspired me to take this article off of my backlog, where it has been sitting for a few weeks. I applaud Tim for stepping down from a company that has demonstrated itself incompatible with his sense of right and wrong, and I want to take a moment to remind you that the rest of us in the tech industry have the same opportunity â€” no, the same obligation as Tim did.</description>
