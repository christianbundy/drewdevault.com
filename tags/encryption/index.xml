      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt makes TLS much easier for pretty much everyone, but can still be annoying to use.

      <description>window.HELP_IMPROVE_VIDEOJS = false;   After my blog post emphasizing the importance of taking control of your privacy, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make a few more posts going over detailed instructions on how to actually do so. Today we have a video that goes over the process of installing Arch Linux with full disk encryption.
This is my first go at publishing videos on my blog, so please provide some feedback in the comments of this article.</description>
