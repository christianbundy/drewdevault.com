      <description>I recently saw a post on Hacker News: &amp;ldquo;Build yourself a Linux&amp;rdquo;, a cool project that guides you through building a simple Linux system. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to Linux from Scratch in that it helps you build a simple Linux system for personal use. I&amp;rsquo;d like to supplement this with some insight into my experience with a more difficult task: building a full blown Linux distribution. The result is agunix, the &amp;ldquo;silver unix&amp;rdquo; system.</description>

      <description>window.HELP_IMPROVE_VIDEOJS = false;   After my blog post emphasizing the importance of taking control of your privacy, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make a few more posts going over detailed instructions on how to actually do so. Today we have a video that goes over the process of installing Arch Linux with full disk encryption.
This is my first go at publishing videos on my blog, so please provide some feedback in the comments of this article.</description>
