      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a liking to a video game called osu! over the past few months. It&amp;rsquo;s a rhythm game where you use move your mouse to circles that appear with the beat, and click (or press a key) at the right time. It looks something like this:
 The key of this game is that the &amp;ldquo;beatmaps&amp;rdquo; (a song plus notes to hit) are user-submitted. There are thousands of them, and the difficulty curve is very long - I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing for 10 months and I&amp;rsquo;m only maybe 70% of the way up the difficulty curve.</description>
