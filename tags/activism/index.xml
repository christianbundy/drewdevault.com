      <description>As many of you have no doubt heard, control of the .org registry has been sold to private interests. There have been attempts to call them to reason, like Save .ORG, but let&amp;rsquo;s be realistic: they knew what they&amp;rsquo;re doing is wrong, the whole time. If they were a commercial entity, our appeals would fall on deaf ears and that would be the end of it. But, they&amp;rsquo;re not a commercial entity - so our appeals may fall on deaf ears, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be the end of it.</description>
