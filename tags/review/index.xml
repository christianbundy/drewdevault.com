      <description>tl;dr: Holy shit! This is the phone I have always wanted. I have never been this excited about the mobile sector before. However: the software side is totally absent â€” phone calls are very dubious, SMS is somewhat dubious, LTE requires some hacks, and everything will have to be written from the ground up.
I have a PinePhone developer edition model, which I paid for out of pocket1 and which took an excruciatingly long time to arrive.</description>
