      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing to you from an airplane on my way back to Philadelphia, after spending a week in Berlin working with the KDE team. It was great to meet those folks and work with them for a while. It&amp;rsquo;ll take me some time to get the taste of C++ out of my mouth, though! In all seriousness, it was a very productive week and I feel like we have learned a lot about each other&amp;rsquo;s projects and have a strengthened interest in collaborating more in the future.</description>
