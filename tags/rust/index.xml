      <description>I have a saying that summarizes my opinion of Rust compared to Go: &amp;ldquo;Go is the result of C programmers designing a new programming language, and Rust is the result of C++ programmers designing a new programming language&amp;rdquo;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just a metaphor - Go was designed by plan9 alumni, an operating system written in C and the source of inspiration for many of Go&amp;rsquo;s features, and Rust was designed by the folks at Mozilla - whose flagship product is one of the largest C++ codebases in the world.</description>
