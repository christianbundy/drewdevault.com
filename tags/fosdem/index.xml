      <description>Currently in a plane on my way home from FOSDEM and, as seems to be a recurring pattern when I fly long distances home after attending a conference, a recap is readily flowing from my fingertips. This was my first year at FOSDEM, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I came. I&amp;rsquo;m already excited for next year! It was also my first year volunteering, which was equally great and another thing I expect to repeat.</description>
