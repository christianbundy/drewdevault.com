      <description>I have a few old standards in my toolbelt that I find myself calling upon most often, but I try to learn enough about many programming languages to reason about whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re suitable to any use-case I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about. The best way is to learn by doing, so getting a general impression of the utility of many languages helps equip you with the knowledge of whether or not they&amp;rsquo;d be useful for a particular problem even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know them yet.</description>
