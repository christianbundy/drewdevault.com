      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s open with some quotes from the Wikipedia article on link rot:
 In 2014, bookmarking site Pinboard&amp;rsquo;s owner Maciej Cegłowski reported a “pretty steady rate” of 5% link rot per year&amp;hellip; approximately 50% of the URLs in U.S. Supreme Court opinions no longer link to the original information&amp;hellip; (analysis of) more than 180,000 links from references in&amp;hellip; three major open access publishers&amp;hellip; found that overall 24.5% of links cited were no longer available.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of thought about whether or not it&amp;rsquo;s even possible to both run a simple website and turn a profit from it and maintain a high quality of service. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about image hosts, considering that I run one (a rather unprofitable one, too), but I would think that my thoughts on this matter apply to more kinds of websites. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;ll just talk about media hosting because that&amp;rsquo;s where I have tangible expertise.</description>
