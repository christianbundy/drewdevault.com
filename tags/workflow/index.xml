      <description>I use aerc as my email client (naturally â€” I wrote it, after all), and I use git send-email to receive patches to many of my projects. I designed aerc specifically to be productive for this workflow, but there are a few extra things that I use in my personal aerc configuration that I thought were worth sharing briefly. This blog post will be boring and clerical, feel free to skip it unless it&amp;rsquo;s something you&amp;rsquo;re interested in.</description>
