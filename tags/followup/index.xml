      <description>This is a follow-up to my last article, Hello world, which is easily the most negatively received article I&amp;rsquo;ve written — a remarkable feat for someone who&amp;rsquo;s written as much flame bait as me. Naturally, the fault lies with the readers.

All jokes aside, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to state my point better. The &amp;ldquo;Hello world&amp;rdquo; article was a lot of work to put together — frustrating work — by the time I had finished collecting numbers, I was exhausted and didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much mind to putting context to them.</description>
