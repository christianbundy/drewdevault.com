      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a common pattern among free- and open-source software projects to include a &amp;ldquo;contrib&amp;rdquo; directory at the top of their source code tree. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this in many projects for many years, but I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it discussed only rarely â€” so here we are!
The contrib directory is used as an unorganized (or, at best, lightly organized) bin of various useful things contributed by the community around the software, but which is not necessarily a good candidate for being a proper part of the software.</description>
