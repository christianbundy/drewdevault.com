      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce that the final pieces have fallen into place for Mercurial support on SourceHut, which is now on-par with our git offering. Special thanks are owed to SourceHut contributor Ludovic Chabant, who has been instrumental in adding Mercurial support to SourceHut. You may have heard about it while this was still experimental - but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to tell you that we have now completely integrated Mercurial support into SourceHut!</description>
