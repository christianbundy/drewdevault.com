      <description>I get this question a lot! The answer is usually&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t. If you already know what you want to do, then the question doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be asked.1 But, if you don&amp;rsquo;t already know what you want to do, then your time might be better spent elsewhere!
The best contributors are always intrinsically motivated. Some contributors show up every now and then who appreciate the value the project gives to them and want to give something back.</description>

      <description>In the past few days, several free software maintainers have come out to discuss the stresses of their work. Though the timing was suggestive, my article last week on the philosophy of project governance was, at best, only tangentially related to this topic - I had been working on that article for a while. I do have some thoughts that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share about what kind of stresses I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with as a FOSS maintainer, and how I&amp;rsquo;ve managed (or often mismanaged) it.</description>
