      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a disturbing trend in the past year or so of various VPN companies advertising to the general, non-technical public. It&amp;rsquo;s great that the general public is starting to become more aware of their privacy online, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of these companies exploiting public paranoia to peddle their wares. Using a VPN in the first place has potentially grave consequences for your privacy - and can often be worse than not using one in the first place.</description>
