      <description>For a few hours here and there over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a side project: Wio. I&amp;rsquo;ll just let the (3 minute) screencast do the talking first:

Note: this video begins with several seconds of grey video. This is normal.
In short, Wio is a Wayland compositor based on wlroots which has a similar look and feel to Plan 9&amp;rsquo;s Rio desktop. It works by running each application in its own nested Wayland compositor, based on Cage - yet another wlroots-based Wayland compositor.</description>
