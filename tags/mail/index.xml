      <description>As part of my work on lists.sr.ht, it was necessary for me to configure a self-contained mail system on localhost that I could test with. I hope that others will go through a similar process in the future when they set up the code for hacking on locally or when working on other email related software, so here&amp;rsquo;s a guide on how you can set it up.
There are lots of things you can set up on a mail server, like virtual mail accounts backed by a relational database, IMAP access, spam filtering, and so on.</description>

      <title>The advantages of an email-driven git workflow</title>

      <description>git 2.18.0 has been released, and with it my first contribution to git has shipped! My patch was for a git feature which remains disappointingly obscure: git send-email. I want to introduce my readers to this feature and speak to the benefits of using an email-driven git workflow - the workflow git was originally designed for.
Email isn&amp;rsquo;t as sexy as GitHub (and its imitators), but it has several advantages over the latter.</description>

      <title>Please use text/plain for email</title>

      <description>A lot of people have come to hate email, and not without good reason. I don&amp;rsquo;t hate using email, and I attribute this to better email habits. Unfortunately, most email clients these days lead users into bad habits that probably contribute to the sad state of email in 2016. The biggest problem with email is the widespread use of HTML email.
Compare email to snail mail. You probably throw out most of the mail you get - it&amp;rsquo;s all junk, ads.</description>
