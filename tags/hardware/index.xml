      <description>I bought a DEC VT220 terminal a while ago, and put it next to my desk at work. I use it to read emails on mutt now, and it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite pleasant. There was some setup involved in making it as comfortable as possible, though.

Hardware First, I have several pieces of hardware involved in this:
 VT220 terminal LK201 keyboard (later made obsolete) USB to serial adapter DB9-&amp;gt;DB29 null modem cable  It took a while to get all of these things, but I was able to get a nice refurbished terminal and a couple of crappy LK201 keyboards.</description>
