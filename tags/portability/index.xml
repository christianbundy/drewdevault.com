      <description>There are many kinds of &amp;ldquo;portability&amp;rdquo; in software. Portability refers to the relative ease of &amp;ldquo;porting&amp;rdquo; a piece of software to another system. That platform might be another operating system, another CPU architecture, another web browser, another filesystem&amp;hellip; and so on. More portable software uses the limited subset of interfaces that are common between systems, and less portable software leverages interfaces specific to a particular system.
Some people think that portability isn&amp;rsquo;t very important, or don&amp;rsquo;t understand the degree to which it&amp;rsquo;s important.</description>
