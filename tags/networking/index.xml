      <description>Disclaimer: I am not a network engineer. That&amp;rsquo;s the point of this blog post, though - I want to share with non-networking people enough information about networking to get by. Hopefully by the end of this post you&amp;rsquo;ll know enough about networking to keep up with a conversation on networking, or know what to search for when something breaks, or know what tech to research more in-depth when you are putting together something new.</description>
