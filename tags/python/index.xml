      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself explaining Python 3&amp;rsquo;s str to people online more and more often lately. There&amp;rsquo;s this ridiculous claim about that Python 3&amp;rsquo;s string handling is broken or somehow worse than Python 2, and today I intend to put that myth to rest. Python 2 strings are broken, and Python 3 strings are sane. The only problem is that you don&amp;rsquo;t grok strings.
The basic problem many people seem to have with Python 3&amp;rsquo;s strings arises when they write code that treats bytes like a string, because that&amp;rsquo;s how it was in Python 2.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with Python for about a year now, and I like pretty much everything about it. There&amp;rsquo;s one thing that&amp;rsquo;s really rather bad and really should not be that bad, however - date &amp;amp; time support. It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous how bad it is in Python. This is what you get with the standard datetime module:
 The current time and strftime, with a reasonable set of properties Time deltas with days, seconds, and microseconds and nothing else Acceptable support for parsing dates and times  What you don&amp;rsquo;t get is:</description>
