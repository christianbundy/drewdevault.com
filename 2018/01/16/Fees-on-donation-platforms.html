    <p>Understanding fees are a really confusing part of supporting creators of things
you like. I provide a few ways for people to support my work, and my supporters
can struggle to understand the differences between them. It comes down to fees,
of which there are several kinds (note: I just made these terms up):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction fees</strong> are charged by the payment processor (the company that
takes down your card number and runs the transaction with your bank). These
are typically in the form of a percentage of the transaction plus a few cents.</li>
<li><strong>Platform fees</strong> are charged by the platform (e.g. Patreon) to run their
operation, typically in the form of a fixed percentage of the transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal fees</strong> are charged to move money from the platform to the
creator&rsquo;s bank account. These vary depending on the withdrawal processor.</li>
<li><strong>Taxes</strong> are also implicated, depending on how much the creator makes.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this adds up to a very confusing picture. I&rsquo;ve made a calculator to help
you sort it out.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For an up-to-date calculation of Patreon&rsquo;s fees, see <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2019/05/06/Calculate-your-doation-fees-for-Patreon.html">the follow-up
post</a>.</p>
