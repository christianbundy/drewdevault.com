  <article>
    <p>An alarmist title, I know, but it&rsquo;s true. If the <a href="https://commonsclause.com/">Commons
clause</a> were to be adopted by all open source
projects, they would cease to be open source<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and therefore the Commons
clause is trying to destroy open source. When this first appeared I spoke out
about it in discussion threads around the net, but didn&rsquo;t think anyone would
take it seriously. Well, yesterday, some parts of Redis <a href="https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/">became proprietary
software</a>.</p>
<p>The Commons Clause promoted by Kevin Wang presents one of the greatest
existential threats to open source I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It preys on a vulnerability
open source maintainers all suffer from, and one I can strongly relate to. It
<em>sucks</em> to not be able to make money from your open source work. It <em>really</em>
sucks when companies are using your work to make money for themselves. If a
solution presents itself, it&rsquo;s tempting to jump at it. But the Commons Clause
doesn&rsquo;t present a solution for supporting open source software. It presents a
framework for turning open source software into proprietary software.</p>
<p>What should we do about open source maintainers not getting the funding
they need? It&rsquo;s a very real problem, and one Kevin has <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinverse/status/1032074268291424257">explicitly asked
us</a> to talk about
before we criticise his solution to it. I would be happy to share my thoughts.
I&rsquo;ve struggled for many years to find a way to finance myself as the maintainer
of many dozens of projects. For a long time it has been a demotivating struggle
with no clear solutions, a struggle which at one point probably left me
vulnerable to the temptations offered by the Common Clause. But today, the
situation is clearly improving.</p>
<p>Personally, I have a harder go of it because very little of my open source
software is appealing to the businesses that have the budget to sponsor them.
Instead, I rely on the (much smaller and less stable) recurring donations of my
individual users. When I started accepting these, I did not think that it was
going to work out. But today, I&rsquo;m making far more money from these donations
than I ever thought possible<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and I see an upwards trend which will
eventually lead me to being able to work on open source full time. If I were
able to add only a few business-level sponsorships to this equation, I think I
would easily have already reached my goals.</p>
<p>There are other options for securing financing for open source, some of which
Redis has already been exploring. Selling a hosted and supported version of
your service is often a good call. Offering consulting support for your
software has also worked for many groups in the past. Some projects succeed with
(A)GPL for everyone and BSD for a price. These are all better avenues to
explore - making your software proprietary is a tragic alternative that should
not be considered.</p>
<p>We need to combine these methods with a greater appreciation for open source in
the business community. Businesses need engineers - appeal to your peers so they
can appeal to the money on behalf of the projects they depend on. A $250/mo
recurring donation to would be a drop in the bucket of most businesses, but a
major boon to any open source project, with which the business will almost
certainly see tangible value-add as a result. When I get to work today I&rsquo;m going
to identify open source projects we use that accept donations and make the
plea<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and keep making the plea week over week until money is spent. You
should, too.</p>
<p>Redis also stands out as a cautionary entry in the history of Contributor
License Agreements. Everyone who has contributed to the now-proprietary Redis
modules has had their hard work stolen and sold by RedisLabs under a proprietary
license. I do not sign CLAs and I think they&rsquo;re a harmful practice for this very
reason. Asking a contributor to sign them is a slap in the face to the good will
which led them to make a contribution in the first place. Don&rsquo;t sign these and
don&rsquo;t ask others to.</p>
<p>I respect antirez<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> very much, but I am sorely disappointed in him. He should
have known better and, if you&rsquo;re reading this, I urge you to roll back your
misguided decision. But the Commons Clause is much more deeply disturbing. What
Kevin is doing will ruin open source software, maybe for good<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I really appreciate some of Kevin&rsquo;s work. <a href="https://fossa.io/">FOSSA</a> is a really
cool tool that can stand to provide some serious value to the open source
community. <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/">TL;DR Legal</a> is a fantastic tool which has
already delivered a tremendous amount of value to open source, and I&rsquo;ve
personally referenced it dozens of times. Thank you, honestly, for your work on
improving the legal landscape of open source. With Commons Clause, however,
Kevin has taken it too far. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">The four
freedoms</a> are <em>important</em>. The
only solution is to bury the Common Clause project. Kill the website and GitHub
repository, and we can try to forget this ever happened.</p>
<p>I understand that turning back is going to be hard, which scares me. I know that
Kevin has already put a lot of effort into it and convinced himself that it&rsquo;s
the Right Thing To Do. It takes work to write the clause, vet it for legal
issues, design a website (a beautiful one, I&rsquo;ll give you that), and to promote
it among your target audience. I know how hard it is to distance yourself from
something you&rsquo;ve staked your personal reputation on. You had only the best
intentions<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, Kevin, but please step back from the ego and do the right thing -
take this down. You stand to undo all of your hard work for the open source
community in one fell swoop with this initiative. I&rsquo;m begging you, stop while
it&rsquo;s not too late.</p>
<p>Man, two angry articles in a row. I have more technical articles coming up, I
promise.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2018-08-23 03:00 UTC:</strong> Richard Stallman of the Free Software
Foundation reached out asking me to clarify the use of &ldquo;open source&rdquo; in this
article. I have refered to the FSF&rsquo;s document on essential freedoms as a
definition of &ldquo;open source&rdquo;. In fact, it is the definition of free software - a
distinct concept. The FSF does not advocate for open source software, but
particularly for free (or &ldquo;libre&rdquo;) software, of which there is some intersection
with open source software. For more information on the difference, refer to
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">Richard&rsquo;s article on the
subject</a>.</p>

<p>As software gets abandoned, making the license more permissive is the last thing on the maintainer&rsquo;s minds. So as the body of Commons Clause software grows, the graveyard will only ever fill. <a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
