  <article>
    <p>This is the third in a series of articles on the subject of writing a Wayland
compositor from scratch using <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>.
Check out <a href="/2018/02/17/Writing-a-Wayland-compositor-1.html">the first article</a>
if you haven&rsquo;t already. We left off with a Wayland server which accepts client
connections and exposes a handful of globals, but does not do anything
particularly interesting yet. Our goal today is to do something interesting -
render a window!</p>
<p>The commit that this article dissects is
<a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/mcwayland/commit/342b7b6">342b7b6</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing we have to do in order to render windows is establish the
<strong>compositor</strong>. The wl_compositor global is used by clients to allocate
<code>wl_surface</code>s, to which they attach <code>wl_buffer</code>s. These surfaces are just a
generic mechanism for sharing buffers of pixels with compositors, and don&rsquo;t
carry an implicit <strong>role</strong>, such as &ldquo;application window&rdquo; or &ldquo;panel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>wlroots provides an implementation of <code>wl_compositor</code>. Let&rsquo;s set aside a
reference for it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">struct mcw_server {
        struct wl_display *wl_display;
        struct wl_event_loop *wl_event_loop;
 
        struct wlr_backend *backend;
<span class="gi">+       struct wlr_compositor *compositor;
</span><span class="gi"></span> 
        struct wl_listener new_output;
</code></pre></div><p>Then rig it up:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">        wlr_primary_selection_device_manager_create(server.wl_display);
        wlr_idle_create(server.wl_display);
 
<span class="gi">+       server.compositor = wlr_compositor_create(server.wl_display,
</span><span class="gi">+                       wlr_backend_get_renderer(server.backend));
</span><span class="gi">+
</span><span class="gi"></span>        wl_display_run(server.wl_display);
        wl_display_destroy(server.wl_display);
</code></pre></div><p>If we run mcwayface now and check out the globals with <code>weston-info</code>, we&rsquo;ll see
a wl_compositor and wl_subcompositor have appeared:</p>
<pre><code>interface: 'wl_compositor', version: 4, name: 8
interface: 'wl_subcompositor', version: 1, name: 9
</code></pre><p>You get a wl_subcompositor for free with the wlroots wl_compositor
implementation. We&rsquo;ll discuss subcompositors in a later article. Speaking of
things we&rsquo;ll discuss in another article, add this too:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">        wlr_primary_selection_device_manager_create(server.wl_display);
        wlr_idle_create(server.wl_display);
 
        server.compositor = wlr_compositor_create(server.wl_display,
                        wlr_backend_get_renderer(server.backend));
 
<span class="gi">+       wlr_xdg_shell_v6_create(server.wl_display);
</span><span class="gi">+
</span><span class="gi"></span>        wl_display_run(server.wl_display);
        wl_display_destroy(server.wl_display);
        return 0;
</code></pre></div><p>Remember that I said earlier that surfaces are just globs of pixels with no
role? xdg_shell is something that can give surfaces a role. We&rsquo;ll talk about it
more in the next article. After adding this, many clients will be able to
connect to your compositor and spawn a window. However, without adding anything
else, these windows will never be shown on-screen. You have to render them!</p>
<p>Something that distinguishes wlroots from libraries like wlc and libweston is
that wlroots does not do any rendering for you. This gives you a lot of
flexibility to render surfaces any way you like. The clients just gave you a
pile of pixels, what you do with them is up to you - maybe you&rsquo;re making a
desktop compositor, or maybe you want to draw them on an Android-style app
switcher, or perhaps your compositor arranges windows in VR - all of this is
possible with wlroots.</p>
<p>Things are about to get complicated, so let&rsquo;s start with the easy part: in
the output_frame handler, we have to get a reference to every wlr_surface we
want to render. So let&rsquo;s iterate over every surface our <code>wlr_compositor</code> is
keeping track of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">        wlr_renderer_begin(renderer, wlr_output);

<span class="gi">+       struct wl_resource *_surface;
</span><span class="gi">+       wl_resource_for_each(_surface, &amp;server-&gt;compositor-&gt;surfaces) {
</span><span class="gi">+               struct wlr_surface *surface = wlr_surface_from_resource(_surface);
</span><span class="gi">+               if (!wlr_surface_has_buffer(surface)) {
</span><span class="gi">+                       continue;
</span><span class="gi">+               }
</span><span class="gi">+               // TODO: Render this surface
</span><span class="gi">+       }
</span><span class="gi"></span>
        wlr_output_swap_buffers(wlr_output, NULL, NULL);
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>wlr_compositor</code> struct has a member named <code>surfaces</code>, which is a list of
<code>wl_resource</code>s. A helper method is provided to produce a <code>wlr_surface</code> from its
corresponding <code>wl_resource</code>. The <code>wlr_surface_has_buffer</code> call is just to make
sure that the client has actually given us pixels to display on this surface.</p>
<p>wlroots might make you do the rendering yourself, but some tools <em>are</em> provided
to help you write compositors with simple rendering requirements:
<strong>wlr_renderer</strong>. We&rsquo;ve already touched on this a little bit, but now we&rsquo;re
going to use it for real. A little bit of OpenGL knowledge is required here. If
you&rsquo;re a complete novice with OpenGL<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I can recommend <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">this
tutorial</a> to help you out. Since you&rsquo;re in a hurry,
we&rsquo;ll do a quick crash course on the concepts necessary to utilize wlr_renderer.
If you get lost, just skip to the next diff and treat it as magic incantations
that make your windows appear.</p>
<p>We have a pile of pixels, and we want to put it on the screen. We can do this
with a <strong>shader</strong>. If you&rsquo;re using wlr_renderer (and mcwayface will be), shaders
are provided for you. To use our shaders, we feed them a <strong>texture</strong> (the pile
of pixels) and a <strong>matrix</strong>. If we treat every pixel coordinate on our surface
as a vector from (0, 0); top left, to (1, 1); bottom right, our goal is to
produce a matrix that we can multiply a vector by to find the final coordinates
on-screen for the pixel to be drawn to. We must project pixel coordinates from
this 0-1 system to the coordinates of our desired rectangle on screen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotcha here, however: the coordinates on-screen <em>also</em> go from 0 to 1,
instead of, for example, 0-1920 and 0-1080. To project coordinates like
&ldquo;put my 640x480 window at coordinates 100,100&rdquo; to screen coordinates, we use an
<strong>orthographic projection matrix</strong>. I know that sounds scary, but don&rsquo;t worry -
wlroots does all of the work for you. Your <code>wlr_output</code> already has a suitable
matrix called <code>transform_matrix</code>, which incorporates into it the current
resolution, scale factor, and rotation of your screen.</p>
<p>Okay, hopefully you&rsquo;re still with me. This sounds a bit complicated, but the
manifestation of all of this nonsense is fairly straightforward. wlroots
provides some tools to make it easy for you. First, we have to prepare a
<code>wlr_box</code> that represents (in output coordinates) where we want the surface to
show up.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">        struct wl_resource *_surface;
        wl_resource_for_each(_surface, &amp;server-&gt;compositor-&gt;surfaces) {
                struct wlr_surface *surface = wlr_surface_from_resource(_surface);
                if (!wlr_surface_has_buffer(surface)) {
                        continue;
                }
<span class="gd">-               // TODO: Render this surface
</span><span class="gd"></span><span class="gi">+               struct wlr_box render_box = {
</span><span class="gi">+                       .x = 20, .y = 20,
</span><span class="gi">+                       .width = surface-&gt;current-&gt;width,
</span><span class="gi">+                       .height = surface-&gt;current-&gt;height
</span><span class="gi">+               };
</span><span class="gi"></span>        }
</code></pre></div><p>Now, here&rsquo;s the great part: all of that fancy math I was just talking about can
be done with a single helper function provided by wlroots: <code>wlr_matrix_project_box</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">        struct wl_resource *_surface;
        wl_resource_for_each(_surface, &amp;server-&gt;compositor-&gt;surfaces) {
                struct wlr_surface *surface = wlr_surface_from_resource(_surface);
                if (!wlr_surface_has_buffer(surface)) {
                        continue;
                }
                struct wlr_box render_box = {
                        .x = 20, .y = 20,
                        .width = surface-&gt;current-&gt;width,
                        .height = surface-&gt;current-&gt;height
                };
<span class="gi">+               float matrix[16];
</span><span class="gi">+               wlr_matrix_project_box(&amp;matrix, &amp;render_box,
</span><span class="gi">+                               surface-&gt;current-&gt;transform,
</span><span class="gi">+                               0, &amp;wlr_output-&gt;transform_matrix);
</span><span class="gi"></span>        }
</code></pre></div><p>This takes a reference to a <code>float[16]</code> to store the output matrix in, a box you
want to project, some other stuff that isn&rsquo;t important right now, and the
projection you want to use - in this case, we just use the one provided by
<code>wlr_output</code>.</p>
<p>The reason we make you understand and perform these steps is because it&rsquo;s
entirely possible that you&rsquo;ll want to do them differently in the future. This
is only the simplest case, but remember that wlroots is designed for <em>every</em>
case. Now that we&rsquo;ve obtained this matrix, we can finally render the surface:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff">        struct wl_resource *_surface;
        wl_resource_for_each(_surface, &amp;server-&gt;compositor-&gt;surfaces) {
                struct wlr_surface *surface = wlr_surface_from_resource(_surface);
                if (!wlr_surface_has_buffer(surface)) {
                        continue;
                }
                struct wlr_box render_box = {
                        .x = 20, .y = 20,
                        .width = surface-&gt;current-&gt;width,
                        .height = surface-&gt;current-&gt;height
                };
                float matrix[16];
                wlr_matrix_project_box(&amp;matrix, &amp;render_box,
                                surface-&gt;current-&gt;transform,
                                0, &amp;wlr_output-&gt;transform_matrix);
<span class="gi">+               wlr_render_with_matrix(renderer, surface-&gt;texture, &amp;matrix, 1.0f);
</span><span class="gi">+               wlr_surface_send_frame_done(surface, &amp;now);
</span><span class="gi"></span>        }
</code></pre></div><p>We also throw in a <code>wlr_surface_send_frame_done</code> for good measure, which lets
the client know that we&rsquo;re done with it so they can send another frame. We&rsquo;re
done! Run mcwayface now, then the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 weston-simple-shm &amp;
$ WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 gnome-terminal -- htop
</code></pre><p>To see the following beautiful image:</p>
<p><img src="https://sr.ht/y_qN.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Run any other clients you like - many of them will work!</p>
<p>We used a bit of a hack today by simply rendering all of the surfaces the
<code>wl_compositor</code> knew of. In practice, we&rsquo;re going to need to extend our
xdg_shell support (and add some other shells, too) to do this properly. We&rsquo;ll
cover this in the next article.</p>
<p>Before you go, a quick note: after this commit, I reorganized things a bit -
we&rsquo;re going to outgrow this single-file approach pretty quickly soon. Check out
