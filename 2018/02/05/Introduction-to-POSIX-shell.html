    <p>What the heck is the POSIX shell anyway? Well, the POSIX (the Portable Operating
System Interface) shell is the standard Unix shell - standard meaning it was
formally defined and shipped in a published standard. This makes shell scripts
written for it portable, something no other shell can lay claim to. The POSIX
shell is basically a formalized version of the venerable Bourne shell, and on
your system it lives at <code>/bin/sh</code>, unless you&rsquo;re one of the unlucky masses for
whom this is a symlink to bash.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-posix-shell">Why use POSIX shell?</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Bourne Again shell&rdquo;, aka bash, is not standardized. Its grammar,
features, and behavior aren&rsquo;t formally written up anywhere, and only one
implementation of bash exists. Without a standard, bash is defined <em>by</em> its
implementation. POSIX shell, on the other hand, has many competing
implementations on many different operating systems - all of which are
compatible with each other because they conform to the standard.</p>
<p>Any shell that utilizes features specific to Bash are not portable, which means
you cannot take them with you to any other system. Many Linux-based systems do
not use Bash or GNU coreutils. Outside of Linux, pretty much everyone but Hurd
does <em>not</em> ship GNU tools, including bash<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. On any of these systems, scripts
using &ldquo;bashisms&rdquo; will not work.</p>
<p>This is bad if your users wish to utilize your software anywhere other than
GNU/Linux. If your build tooling utilizes bashisms, your software will not build
on anything but GNU/Linux. If you ship runtime scripts that use bashisms, your
software will not <em>run</em> on anything but GNU/Linux. The case for sticking to
POSIX shell in shipping software is compelling, but I argue that you should
stick to POSIX shell for your personal scripts, too. You might not care now, but
when you feel like flirting with other Unicies you&rsquo;ll thank me when all of your
scripts work.</p>
<p>One place where POSIX shell does <em>not</em> shine is for interactive use - a place
where I think bash sucks, too. Any shell you want to use for your day-to-day
command line work is okay in my book. I use fish. Use whatever you like
interactively, but stick to POSIX sh for your scripts.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-posix-shell">How do I use POSIX shell?</h2>
<p>At the top of your scripts, put <code>#!/bin/sh</code>. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about using
<code>env</code> here like you might have been trained to do with bash: <code>/bin/sh</code> is the
standardized location for the POSIX shell, and any standards-conforming system
will either put it there or make your script work anyway.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The next step is to avoid bashisms. There are many, but here are a few that
might trip you up:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[[ condition ]]</code> does not work; use <code>[ condition ]</code></li>
<li>Arrays do not work; <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_05">use IFS</a></li>
<li>Local variables do not work; use a subshell</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to learn about POSIX shell is to <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html">read the
standard</a> -
it&rsquo;s not too dry and shorter than you think.</p>
<h2 id="using-standard-coreutils">Using standard coreutils</h2>
<p>The last step to writing portable scripts is to use portable tools. Your system
may have GNU coreutils installed, which provides tools like <code>grep</code> and <code>cut</code>.
Unfortunately, GNU has extended these tools with its own non-portable flags and
tools. It&rsquo;s important that you avoid these.</p>
<p>One dead giveaway of a non-portable flag is long flags, e.g. <code>grep --file=FILE</code>
as opposed to <code>grep -f</code>. The POSIX standard only defines the <code>getopt</code> function -
not the proprietary GNU <code>getopt_long</code> function that&rsquo;s used to interpret long
options. As a result, no long flags are standardized. You might worry that this
will make your scripts difficult to understand, but I think that on the whole it
will not. Shell scripts are already pretty alien and require some knowledge to
understand. Is knowledge of what the magic word <code>grep</code> means much different
from knowledge of what <code>grep -E</code> means?</p>
<p>I also like that short flags allow you to make more concise command lines. Which
is better: <code>ps --all --format=user --without-tty</code>, or <code>ps -aux</code>? If you are
inclined to think the former, do you also prefer <code>function(a, b, c) { return a + b + c; }</code> over <code>(a, b, c) =&gt; a + b + c</code>?  Conciseness matters, and POSIX shell
supports comments if necessary!</p>
<p>Some tips for using short flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be collapsed: <code>cmd -a -b -c</code> is equivalent to <code>cmd -abc</code></li>
<li>If they take additional arguments, either a space or no separation is
acceptable: <code>cmd -f&quot;hello world&quot;</code> or <code>cmd -f &quot;hello world&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A good reference for learning about standardized commands is, once again, <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">the
standard</a>. From this page,
search for the command you want, or navigate through &ldquo;Shell &amp; Utilities&rdquo; -&gt;
&ldquo;Utilities&rdquo; for a list. If you have <code>man-pages</code> installed, you will also find
POSIX man pages installed on your system with the <code>p</code> postfix, such as <code>man 1p grep</code>. Note: at the time of writing, the POSIX man pages do not use dashes if
your locale is UTF-8, which makes searching for flags with <code>/</code> difficult. Use
<code>env LC_ALL=POSIX man 1p grep</code> if you need to search for flags, and I&rsquo;ll speak
to the maintainer of man-pages about this.</p>

<p><em>2018-05-15 correction</em>: <code>#!/bin/sh</code> is unfortunately not standardized by POSIX. However, I still recommend its use, as most operating systems will place it there.
