I'm writing this month's status update from a brand-new desktop workstation (well, I re-used the GPU), my first new workstation in about 10 years. I hope this new one lasts for another decade! I aimed for something smaller and lightweight this time â€” it's a Mini-ITX build. I've only been running this for a few days, so let me tell you about the last few accomplishments which are accountable to my venerable workstation's final days of life.

First, there's been a ton of important work completed for SourceHut's API 2.0 plans. All of the main blockers for the first version of meta.sr.ht's writable GraphQL API are resolved, and after implementing a few more resolvers it should be in a shippable state. This included riggings for database transactions, simplification of the mini-"ORM" I built, and support for asyncronous work like delivering webhooks. The latter called for a new library, dowork, which you're free to reuse to bring asyncronous work processing to your Go programs.

I also built a new general-purpose daemon for SourceHut called chartsrv, which can be used to generate graphs from Prometheus data.

I've been getting more into Gemini this month, and have completed three (or four?) whole projects for it:

=> https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gmni/ gmni and gmnlm: a client implementation and line-mode browser
=> https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gmnisrv/ gmnisrv: a server implementation
=> https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/kineto/ kineto: an HTTP->Gemini portal

The (arguably) fourth project is the completion of a Gemini version of this blog, which is available at gemini://drewdevault.com, or via the kineto portal at https://portal.drewdevault.com. I'll be posting some content exclusively on Gemini (and I already have!), so get yourself a client if you want to tune in.

I have also invested some effort into himitsu, a project I shelved for so long that you probably don't remember it. Worry not, I have rewritten the README.md to give you a better introduction to it.

Bonus update: two new BARE implementations have appeared: OCaml and Java.

That's all for now! I'll see you for the next update soon. Thanks for your support!
