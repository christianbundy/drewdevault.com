    <p>In many fields, professional-grade tooling requires a high degree of knowledge
and training to use properly, usually more than is available to the amateur. The
typical mechanic&rsquo;s tool chest makes my (rather well-stocked, in my opinion) tool
bag look quite silly. A racecar driver is using a vehicle which is much more
complex than, say, the soccer mom&rsquo;s mini-van. Professional-grade tools are,
necessarily, more complex and require skill to use.</p>
<p>There are two attributes to consider when classifying these tools: <em>utility</em> and
<em>usability</em>. These are not the same thing. Some tools have both high utility and
high usability, such as a pencil. Some are highly usable, but of low utility,
such as a child&rsquo;s tricycle. Tools of both low-utility and low-usability are
uncommon, but I&rsquo;m sure you can think of a few examples from your own experiences
:)</p>
<p>When designing tools, it is important to consider both of these attributes, and
it helps to keep the intended audience in mind. I think that many programmers
today are overly concerned with usability, and insufficiently concerned with
utility. Some programmers (although this sort prefers &ldquo;developer&rdquo;) go so far as
to fetishize usability <em>at the expense</em> of utility.</p>
<p>In some cases, sacrificing utility in favor of usability is an acceptable
trade-off. In the earlier example&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s unlikely that anyone would argue
that the soccer mom should be loading the tots into an F1 racecar. However, it&rsquo;s
equally absurd to suppose that the F1 driver should bring a mini-van to the race
track. In the realm of programming, this metaphor speaks most strongly to me in
the design of programming tools.</p>
<p>I argue that most programmers are professionals who are going to invest several
years into learning the craft. This is the audience for whom I design my tools.
What trouble is it to spend an extra hour learning a somewhat less intuitive
<a href="https://git-send-email.io">code review tool</a> when the programming language
whose code you&rsquo;re reviewing required months to learn and years to master?</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time_2x.png" alt="An XKCD comic which depicts a table that compares &ldquo;time to improve task&rdquo; versus &ldquo;time saved by improvement&rdquo; and how to figure if the improvement is worthwhile"></a></p>
<p>I write tools to maximize the productivity of professional programmers. Ideally,
we can achieve both usability and utility, and often we do just that.
But, sometimes, these tools require a steeper learning curve. If they are <em>more
useful</em> in spite of that, they will usually save heaps of time in the long run.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on dumbing down our tools, maximizing usability at the
expense of utility, we should focus on making powerful tools <em>and</em> fostering a
culture of <em>mentorship</em>. Senior engineers should be helping their juniors learn
and grow to embrace and build a new generation of more and more productive
tooling, considering usability all the while but never at the expense of
utility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll address mentorship in more detail in future posts. For now, I&rsquo;ll just state
that mentorship is the praxis of my tooling philosophy. We can build better,
more powerful, and more productive tools, even if they require a steeper
learning curve, so long as we&rsquo;re prepared to teach people how to use them, and
they&rsquo;re prepared to learn.</p>
