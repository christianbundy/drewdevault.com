  <article>
    <p>Research conducted on human beings, at least outside of the domain of
technology, has to meet a minimum standard of ethical reasoning called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent">informed consent</a>. Details
vary, but the general elements of informed consent are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disclosure of the nature and purpose of the research and its implications
(risks and benefits) for the participant, and the confidentiality of the
collected information.</li>
<li>An adequate understanding of these facts on the part of the participant,
requiring an accessible explanation in lay terms and an assessment of
understanding.</li>
<li>The participant must exercise voluntary agreement, without coercion or fear
of repercussions (e.g. not being allowed to use your website).</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I pose the following question: if your analytics script wouldn&rsquo;t pass muster
at your university&rsquo;s ethics board, then what the hell is it doing on your
website? Can we not meet this basic minimum standard of ethical decency and
respect for our users?</p>
<p>Opt-out is not informed consent. Manually unticking dozens of third-party
trackers from a cookie pop-up is not informed consent. &ldquo;By continuing to use
this website, you agree to&hellip;&rdquo; is not informed consent. &ldquo;Install <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock
Origin</a>&rdquo; is not informed consent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily believe that ethical user tracking is <em>impossible</em>, but I
know for damn sure that most of these &ldquo;pro-privacy&rdquo; analytics solutions which
have been cropping up in the wake of the GDPR don&rsquo;t qualify, either.</p>
<p>Our industry&rsquo;s fundamental failure to respect users, deliberately mining their
data without consent and without oversight for profit, is the reason why we&rsquo;re
seeing legal crackdowns in the form of the GDPR and similar legislation.  Our
comeuppance is well-earned, and I hope that the regulators give it teeth in
enforcement. The industry response — denial and looking for ways to weasel
out of these ethical obligations — is a strategy on borrowed time. The law
is not a computer program, and it is not executed by computers: it is executed
by human beings who can see through your horseshit. You&rsquo;re not going to be able
to seek out some narrow path you can walk to skirt the regulations and keep
spying on people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to stop spying on people.</p>
<p><em>P.S. If you still want the data you might get from analytics without
compromising on ethics, here&rsquo;s an idea: compensate users for their participation
in your research. Woah, what a wild idea! That&rsquo;s not very growth hacker of you,
Drew.</em></p>
