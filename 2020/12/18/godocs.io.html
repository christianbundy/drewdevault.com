    <p>The inevitable forced migration to pkg.go.dev is shipping with known
regressions. It&rsquo;s rolling on out without fixing, for example, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38986">a problem I
pointed out in June</a>. godoc.org uses
special meta tags<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> which can link up a source path and line number with a URL
for a git host&rsquo;s source view. pkg.go.dev instead hardcodes a list of hosted git
forges. git.sr.ht is among them — getting it added was my introduction to
this mess — but <em>only</em> the hosted instance, and no third-party git.sr.ht
instances. hg.sr.ht is still missing, too. The Go team committed to not shipping
with regressions, but that was (predictably) false.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/01/pkg-go-dev-sucks.html">previously written about</a> the botched pkg.go.dev roll-out.
It&rsquo;s a microcosm of Google&rsquo;s toxic engineering culture, demonstrating how Google
engineers are out-of-touch with the values and needs of their community. It
initially shipped as a proprietary replacement, with no intention of making it
open source until the community demanded it, under the rationale that it wasn&rsquo;t
useful for intranets.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> They didn&rsquo;t take the opportunity to address any of the
flaws in godoc.org&rsquo;s design, and instead introduced regressions and made those
flaws even worse.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s shipping, in this state, in Q1 2021.</p>
<p>This pattern appears to be common to many Google affairs, because it&rsquo;s the
primary means by which Googlers get promoted.</p>
<p>In light of this, <a href="https://godocs.io">godocs.io</a> is now available, running the
last version of godoc.org that pre-dates pkg.go.dev. It is my intention to keep
this running indefinitely, and you&rsquo;re welcome to use it for your own purposes or
projects.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t made any especially interesting changes, but the source code <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gddo">is
available on git.sr.ht</a> — feel free to
send patches along to <a href="mailto:sir@cmpwn.com">sir@cmpwn.com</a> if you want to
submit (minor) improvements or bugfixes. One change I will definitely have to
make is a new solution for full-text search (probably just Postgres), because I
don&rsquo;t want to use AppEngine. If anyone wants to help with this, I would
appreciate your patch.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gddo/commit/c916d5629996d6a4cbd67e48e25af40a966b5d69">implemented full-text search</a>
on top of Postgres in about 30 minutes with a friend&rsquo;s help. Aside from the
dataset (which will grow naturally as the service is used), this should be for
all intents and purposes equivalent to pre-pkg.go.dev godoc.org now. Enjoy!</p>
