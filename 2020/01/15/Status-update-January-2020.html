    <p>I forgot to write this post this morning, and I&rsquo;m on cup 3 of coffee while
knee-deep in some arcane work with tarballs in Python. Forgive the brevity of
this introduction. Let&rsquo;s get right into the status update.</p>
<p>First of all, <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/">FOSDEM 2020</a> is taking place on February 1st and 2nd, and
I&rsquo;m planning on being there again this year. I hope to see you there! I&rsquo;ll be
hosting another <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/bof_sourcehut/">small session</a> for SourceHut and aerc users
where I&rsquo;ll take questions, demo some new stuff, and give out stickers.</p>
<p>In Wayland news, the upcoming Sway 1.3 release is getting very close - rc3 is
planned to ship later today. We&rsquo;ve confirmed that it&rsquo;ll ship with VNC support
via <a href="https://github.com/any1/wayvnc">wayvnc</a> and improvements to input latency.
I haven&rsquo;t completed much extra work on Casa (and &ldquo;Sway Mobile&rdquo; alongside it),
but there have been some small improvements. I did find some time to work on
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sedna">Sedna</a>, however. We&rsquo;ve decided to use it as
a proving grounds for the new wlroots scene graph API, which plans to
incorporate Simon Ser&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/emersion/libliftoff">libliftoff</a> and put to rest the eternal
debate over how wlroots renderer should take shape. This&rsquo;ll be <em>lots</em> of work
but the result will be a remarkably good foundation on which we can run
performant compositors on a huge variety of devices — and, if we&rsquo;re
lucky, might help resolve the Nvidia problem. I also did a bit more work on the
<a href="https://wayland-book.com">Wayland Book</a>, refactoring some of the chapter
ordering to make more sense and getting started with the input chapter. More
soon.</p>
<p>On SourceHut, lots of new developments have been underway. The latest round of
performance improvements for git.sr.ht finally landed with the introduction of
new server hardware, and it&rsquo;s finally competitive with its peers in terms of
push and web performance. I&rsquo;ve also overhauled our monitoring infrastructure
<a href="https://metrics.sr.ht">and made it public</a>. Our <a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2020-01-13-sourcehut-q4-2019-financial-report/">Q4 2019 financial
report</a> was also published earlier this week. I&rsquo;m currently
working on pushing forward through the self-service data ownership goals, and
we&rsquo;ve already seen some improvements in that todo.sr.ht can now re-import
tracker exports from itself or other todo.sr.ht instances.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working more on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/himitsu">himitsu</a>
recently, though I&rsquo;m taking it pretty slowly because it&rsquo;s a security-sensitive
project. Most of the crypto code has been written at this point - writing
encrypted secrets to disk, reading and writing the key index - but reading
encrypted secrets back from the disk remains to be implemented. I know there are
some bugs in the current implementation, which I&rsquo;ll be sorting out before I
write much more code. I also implemented most of the support code for the Unix
socket RPC, and implemented a couple of basic commands which have been helpful
with proving out the secret store code (proving that it&rsquo;s wrong, at least).</p>
<p>Simon Ser&rsquo;s <a href="https://mrsh.sh">mrsh</a> has also been going very well lately, and is
now a nearly complete implementation of the POSIX shell. I&rsquo;ve started working on
something I&rsquo;ve long planned to build on top of mrsh: a comfortable interactive
shell, inspired by fish&rsquo;s interactive mode, but with a strictly POSIX syntax. I
call the project <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/imrsh">imrsh</a>, for interactive
mrsh. I&rsquo;ve already got it in somewhat good shape, but many of the features
remain to be implemented. The bulk of the work was in Simon&rsquo;s mrsh, so it
shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to add a pretty interface on top. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today. In the coming month I hope to expand on each of these, and
I&rsquo;m also working on a new Secret Project which may start bearing fruits soon
(but likely not). Thank you for your continued support! I&rsquo;ll see you at FOSDEM.</p>
