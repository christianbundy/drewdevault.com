  <article>
    <p>This is a follow-up to my last article, <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/01/04/Slow.html">Hello
world</a>, which is easily the most
negatively received article I&rsquo;ve written — a remarkable feat for someone
who&rsquo;s written as much flame bait as me. Naturally, the fault lies with the
readers.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1984/" rel="noopener"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/misinterpretation_2x.png" width="294" /></a></p>
<p>All jokes aside, I&rsquo;ll try to state my point better. The &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo; article
was a lot of work to put together — frustrating work — by the time
I had finished collecting numbers, I was exhausted and didn&rsquo;t pay much mind to
putting context to them. This left a lot of it open to interpretation, and a lot
of those interpretations didn&rsquo;t give the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s worth clarifying that the assembly program I gave is a
<em>hypothetical, idealized</em> hello world program, and in practice not even the
assembly program is safe from bloat. After it&rsquo;s wrapped up in an ELF, even after
stripping, the binary bloats up to <strong>157×</strong> the size of the
actual machine code. I had hoped this would be more intuitively clear, but the
take-away is that the ideal program is a pipe dream, not a standard to which the
others are held. As the infinite frictionless plane in vacuum is to physics,
that assembly program is to compilers.</p>
<p>I also made the mistake of including the runtime in the table. What I wanted you
to notice about the timestamp is that it <em>rounds to zero</em> for 15 of the 21 test
cases, and arguably only one or two approach the realm of human perception.
It&rsquo;s meant to lend balance to the point I&rsquo;m making with the number of syscalls:
despite the complexity on display, the user generally can&rsquo;t even tell. The other
problem with including the runtimes is that it makes it look like a benchmark,
which it&rsquo;s not (you&rsquo;ll notice that if you grep for &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo;, you will find no
results).</p>
<p>Another improvement would have been to group rows of the table by orders of
magnitude (in terms of number of syscalls), and maybe separate the outliers in
each group. There is little difference between many of the languages in the
middle of the table, but when one of them is your favorite language, &ldquo;stacking
it up&rdquo; against its competitors like this is a good way to get the reader&rsquo;s blood
pumping and bait some flames. If your language appears to be represented
unfavorably on this chart, you&rsquo;re likely to point out the questionable
methodology, golf your way to a more generous sample code, etc; things I could
have done myself were I trying to make a benchmark rather than a point about
complexity.</p>
<p>And hidden therein is my actual point: complexity. There has long been a trend
in computing of endlessly piling on the abstractions, with no regard for the
consequences. The web is an ever growing mess of complexity, with larger and
larger blobs of inscrutable JavaScript being shoved down pipes with no regard
for the pipe&rsquo;s size or the bridge toll charged by the end-user&rsquo;s telecom.
Electron apps are so far removed from hardware that their jarring non-native UIs
can take seconds to respond and eat up the better part of your RAM to merely
show a text editor or chat application.</p>
<p>The PC in front of me is literally five thousand times faster than the graphing
calculator in my closet - but the latter can boot to a useful system in a
fraction of a millisecond, while my PC takes almost a minute. Productivity per
CPU cycle per Watt is the lowest it&rsquo;s been in decades, and is orders of
magnitude (plural) beneath its potential. So far as most end-users are
concerned, computers haven&rsquo;t improved in meaningful ways in the past 10 years,
and in many respects have become worse. The cause is well-known: programmers
have spent the entire lifetime of our field recklessly piling abstraction on top
of abstraction on top of abstraction. We&rsquo;re more concerned with shoving more
spyware at the problem than we are with optimization, outside of a small number
of high-value problems like video decoding.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Programs have grown fat and
reckless in scope, and it affects literally everything, even down to the last
bastion of low-level programming: C.</p>
<p>I use syscalls as an approximation of this complexity. Even for one of the
simplest possible programs, there is a huge amount of abstraction and complexity
that comes with many approaches to its implementation. If I just print &ldquo;hello
world&rdquo; in Python, users are going to bring along almost a million lines of code
to run it, the fraction of which isn&rsquo;t dead code is basically a rounding error.
This isn&rsquo;t <em>always</em> a bad thing, but it often is and no one is thinking about
it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the true message I wanted you to take away from my article: most
programmers aren&rsquo;t thinking about this complexity. Many choose tools because
it&rsquo;s easier for them, or because it&rsquo;s what they know, or because developer time
is more expensive than the user&rsquo;s CPU cycles or battery life and the engineers
aren&rsquo;t signing the checks. I hoped that many people would be surprised at just
how much work their average programming language could end up doing even when
given simple tasks.</p>
<p>The point was not that your programming language is wrong, or that being higher
up on the table is better, or that programming languages should be blindly
optimizing these numbers. The point is, if these numbers surprised you, then you
should find out why! I&rsquo;m a systems programmer — I want you to be
interested in your systems! And if this surprises you, I wonder what else
might&hellip;</p>
<p>I know that article didn&rsquo;t do a good job of explaining any of this. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now to address more specific comments:</p>
<p><strong>What the fuck is a syscall</strong>?</p>
<p>This question is more common with users of the languages which make more of
them, ironically. A syscall is when your program asks the kernel to do something
for it. This causes a transition from <em>user space</em> to <em>kernel space</em>. This
transition is one of the more expensive things your programs can do, but a
program that doesn&rsquo;t make any syscalls is not a useful program: syscalls are
necessary to do any kind of I/O (input or output). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">Wikipedia
page</a>.</p>
<p>On Linux, you can use the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/strace">strace</a> tool to
analyze the syscalls your programs are making, which is how I obtained the
numbers in the original article.</p>
<p><strong>This &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo; is biased against JIT&rsquo;d and interpreted languages</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, it is. It <em>is</em> true that many programming environments have to factor
in a &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; time. This argument on its face-value is apparently validated by
the cargo-culted (and often correct) wisdom that benchmarks should be conducted
with timers in-situ, post warm-up period, with the measured task being
repeated many times so that trends become more obvious.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It&rsquo;s precisely these
details, which the conventional benchmarking wisdom aims to obscure, that I&rsquo;m
trying to cast a light on. While a benchmark which shows how quickly a bunch of
programming languages can print &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; a million times<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> might be
interesting, it&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m going for here.</p>
<p><strong>Rust is doing important things with those syscalls</strong>.</p>
<p>My opinion on this is mixed: yes, stack guards are useful. However, my &ldquo;hello
world&rdquo; program has zero chance of causing a stack overflow. In theory, Rust
should be able to reckon whether or not many programs are at risk of stack
overflow.  If not, it can ask the programmer to specify some bounds, or it can
emit the stack guards <em>only in those cases</em>. The worst option is panicking, and
I&rsquo;m surprised that Crustaceans feel like this is sufficient. Funny, given their
obsession with &ldquo;zero cost&rdquo; abstractions, that a nonzero-cost abstraction would
be so fiercely defended. They&rsquo;re already used to overlong compile times, adding
more analysis probably won&rsquo;t be noticed ;)</p>
<p><strong>Go is doing important things with those syscalls</strong>.</p>
<p>On this I wholly disagree. I hate the Go runtime, it&rsquo;s the worst thing about an
otherwise great language. Go programs are almost impossible to debug for having
to sift through mountains of unrelated bullshit the program is doing, all to
support a concurrency/parallelism model that I also strongly dislike. There are
some bad design decisions in Golang and stracing the average Go program brings a
lot of them to light. Illumos has many of its own problems, but <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/wesolows/2014/12/29/golang-is-trash/">this
article</a> about
porting Go to it covers a number of related problems.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, Zig is competitive with assembly?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I totally had the same reaction. I&rsquo;m interested to see how it measures up
under more typical workloads. People keep asking me what I think about Zig in
general, and I think it has potential, but I also have a lot of complaints. It&rsquo;s
not likely to replace C for me, but it might have a place somewhere in my stack.</p>

<p>This approach is the most &ldquo;fair&rdquo; for comparison&rsquo;s sake, but it also often obscures a lot of the practical value of the benchmark in the first place. For example, how often is the branch predictor and L1 cache going to be warmed up in favor of the measured code in practice? <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
