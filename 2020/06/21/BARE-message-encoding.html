  Introducing the BARE message encoding

  <article>
    <p>I like stateless tokens. We started with state<em>ful</em> tokens: where a generated
string acts as a unique identifier for a resource, and the resource itself is
looked up separately. For example, your sr.ht OAuth token is a stateful token:
we just generate a random number and hand it to you, something like
&ldquo;a97c4aeeec705f81539aa&rdquo;. To find the information associated with this token, we
query the database — our local <em>state</em> — to find it.</p>
<a href="#announcement">

</a>
<p>But, increasingly, we&rsquo;ve been using stateless tokens, which are a bloody good
idea. The idea is that, instead of using random numbers, you encode the actual
state you need into the token. For example, your sr.ht login session cookie is a
JSON blob which is encrypted and base64 encoded. Rather than associating your
session with a record in the database, we just decrypt the cookie when your
browser sends it to us, and the session information is right there. This
improves performance and simplicity in a single stroke, which is a huge win in
my book.</p>
<p>There is one big problem, though: stateless tokens tend to be a lot larger than
their stateful counterparts. For a stateful token, we just need to generate
enough random numbers to be both unique and unpredictable, and then store the
rest of the data elsewhere. Not so for a stateless token, whose length is a
function of the amount of state which has been sequestered into it. Here&rsquo;s an
example: the cursor fields on the new GraphQL APIs are stateless. This is one of
them:</p>
<pre><code>gAAAAABe7-ysKcvmyavwKIT9k1uVLx_GXI6OunjFIHa3OJmK3eBC9NT6507PBr1WbuGtjlZSTYLYvicH2EvJXI1eAejR4kuNExpwoQsogkE9Ua6JhN10KKYzF9kJKW0hA_-737NurotB
</code></pre>
<p>A whopping 141 characters long! It&rsquo;s hardly as convenient to lug this monster
around. Most of the time it&rsquo;ll be programs doing the carrying, but it&rsquo;s still
annoying when you&rsquo;re messing with the API and debugging your programs. This
isn&rsquo;t an isolated example, either: these stateless tokens tend to be large
throughout sr.ht.</p>
<p>In general, JSON messages are pretty bulky. They represent everything as text,
which can be 2x as inefficient for certain kinds of data right off the bat.
They&rsquo;re also self-describing: the schema of the message is encoded into the
message itself; that is, the names of fields, hierarchy of objects, and data
types.</p>
<p>There are many alternatives that attempt to address this problem, and I
considered many of them. Here were a selected few of my conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">protobuf</a>: too
complicated and too fragile, and I&rsquo;ve never been fond of the generated code
for protobufs in any language. Writing a third-party protobuf implementation
would be a gargantuan task, and there&rsquo;s no standard. RPC support is also
undesirable for this use-case.</li>
<li><a href="https://capnproto.org/">Cap&rsquo;n Proto</a>: fixed width, alignment, and so on
— good for performance, bad for message size. Too complex. RPC support
is also undesirable for this use-case. I also passionately hate C++ and I
cannot in good faith consider something which makes it their primary target.</li>
<li><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">BSON</a>: MonogoDB implementation details have leaked into
the specification, and it&rsquo;s extensible in the worst way. I appreciate that
JSON is a closed spec and no one is making vendor extensions for it —
and, similarly, a diverse extension ecosystem is not something I want to see
for this technology. Additionally, encoding schema into the message is wasting
space.</li>
<li><a href="https://msgpack.org/">MessagePack</a>: ruled out for similar reasons: too much
extensibility, and the schema is encoded into the message, wasting space.</li>
<li><a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a>: ruled out for similar reasons: too much
extensibility, and the schema is encoded into the message. Has the advantage
of a specification, but the disadvantage of that spec being 54 pages long.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were others, but hopefully this should give you an idea of what I was
thinking about when evaluating my options.</p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything which meets my criteria just right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized for small messages</li>
<li>Standardized</li>
<li>Easy to implement</li>
<li>Universal — little to no support for extensions</li>
<li>Simple — no extra junk that isn&rsquo;t contributing to the core mission</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution is evident.</p>

<p><a id="announcement"></a></p>
<h2 id="bare-binary-application-record-encoding">BARE: Binary Application Record Encoding</h2>
<p><a href="https://baremessages.org">BARE</a> meets all of the criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimized for small messages</strong>: messages are binary, not self-describing,
and have no alignment or padding.</li>
<li><strong>Standardized &amp; simple</strong>: the specification is just over 1,000 words —
shorter than this blog post.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to implement</strong>: the first implementation (for Go) was done in a single
weekend (this weekend, in fact).</li>
<li><strong>Universal</strong>: there is room for user extensibility, but it&rsquo;s done in a manner
which does not require expanding the implementation nor making messages which
are incompatible with other implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stateless tokens aren&rsquo;t the only messages that I&rsquo;ve wanted a simple binary
encoding for. On many occasions I&rsquo;ve evaluated and re-evaluated the same set of
existing solutions, and found none of them quite right. I hope that BARE will
help me solve many of these problems in the future, and I hope you find it
useful, too!</p>
<p>The cursor token I shared earlier in the article looks like this when encoded
with BARE:</p>
<pre><code>gAAAAABe7_K9PeskT6xtLDh_a3JGQa_DV5bkXzKm81gCYqNRV4FLJlVvG3puusCGAwQUrKFLO-4LJc39GBFPZomJhkyqrowsUw==
</code></pre>
<p>100 characters (41 fewer than JSON), which happens to be the minimum size of a
padded <a href="https://github.com/fernet/spec/">Fernet</a> message. If we compare only the
cleartext:</p>
<pre><code>JSON: eyJjb3VudCI6MjUsIm5leHQiOiIxMjM0NSIsInNlYXJjaCI6bnVsbH0=
BARE: EAUxMjM0NQA=
</code></pre>
<p>Much improved!</p>
<p>BARE also has an optional schema language for defining your message structure.
Here&rsquo;s a sample:</p>
<pre><code>type PublicKey data&lt;128&gt;
type Time string # ISO 8601

enum Department {
  ACCOUNTING
  ADMINISTRATION
  CUSTOMER_SERVICE
  DEVELOPMENT

  # Reserved for the CEO
  JSMITH = 99
}

type Customer {
  name: string
  email: string
  address: Address
  orders: []{
    orderId: i64
    quantity: i32
  }
  metadata: map[string]data
}

type Employee {
  name: string
  email: string
  address: Address
  department: Department
  hireDate: Time
  publicKey: optional
  metadata: map[string]data
}

type Person (Customer | Employee)

type Address {
  address: [4]string
  city: string
  state: string
  country: string
}
</code></pre><p>You can feed this into a code generator and get types which can encode &amp; decode
these messages. But, you can also describe your schema just using your
language&rsquo;s existing type system, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="nx">Coordinates</span> <span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Bonus: you can get the schema language definition for this struct with
<code>schema.SchemaFor(coords)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="bare-is-under-development">BARE is under development</h2>
<p>There are some possible changes that could come to BARE before finalizing the
specification. Here are some questions I&rsquo;m thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the schema language include support for arbitrary annotations to
inform code generators? I&rsquo;m inclined to think &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but if you use BARE and
find yourself wishing for this, tell me about it.</li>
<li>Should BARE have first-class support for bitfield enums?</li>
<li>Should maps be ordered?</li>
</ul>
