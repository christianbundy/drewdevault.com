  <article>
    <p>Email is important to my daily workflow, and I&rsquo;ve built many tools which
encourage productive use of it for software development. As such, I&rsquo;m often
asked for advice on choosing a good email service provider. Personally, I run
my own mail servers, but about a year ago I signed up for and evaluated many
different service providers available today so that I could make informed
recommendations to people. Here are my top picks, as well as the criteria by
which they were evaluated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, almost all mail providers fail to meet my criteria.  As such, I
can only recommend two: Migadu and mailbox.org.</p>
<h1 id="1-migadu">#1: Migadu</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.migadu.com/">Migadu</a> is my go-to recommendation
for a mail service provider.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Migadu is a small company with strong values and no outside capital (i.e.
no profit-motivated external influence). Email support and a human being
answers, and their leadership is accessible if you have questions or feedback.</li>
<li>Their pricing is based on bandwidth usage, and does not rely on artificial
scarcity like limited domain names or mailboxes.</li>
<li>Has lots of features for your postmaster - you can treat it as a managed mail
server for your organization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have suffered from some outages in the past. The global mail system is
tolerant of such outages - you don&rsquo;t have to worry about messages being lost
if they were sent during an outage. Still, being unable to access your mail is
a problem.</li>
<li>If you are on a trial account, they will put an advertisement into your email
signature. I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s ever appropriate for a mail service
provider to edit your outgoing emails for any reason, and certainly not to
advertise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full disclosure: SourceHut and Migadu agreed to a consulting arrangement to
build their <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~migadu/alps">new webmail system</a>, which should
be going into production soon. However, I had evaluated and started recommending
Migadu prior to the start of this project, and I believe that Migadu fares well
under the criteria I give at the end of this post.</p>
<h1 id="2-mailboxorg">#2: mailbox.org</h1>
<p><a href="https://mailbox.org/en/">Mailbox.org</a> may be desirable if you wish to have a
more curated experience, and less hands-on access to postmaster-specific
features.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent first-class support for PGP, and many other strong security and
privacy features are available.</li>
<li>Was able to speak to the CEO directly to discuss my concerns and feedback, and
have my questions answered. Raised some bugs and they were fixed in short
order.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The interface is a little bit too JavaScript heavy for my tastes, and suffer
from some bugs and lack of polish.</li>
<li>They are a German company serving mostly German customers - German text leaks
into the UI and documentation in some places.</li>
<li>Completing a Google captcha is required to sign up.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="others">Others</h1>
<p>Evaluated but not recommended: disroot, fastmail, posteo.de, poste.io,
protonmail, tutanota, riseup, cock.li, teknik, runbox, megacorp mail (gmail,
outlook, etc).</p>
<h1 id="criteria-for-a-good-mail-service-provider">Criteria for a good mail service provider</h1>
<p>The following criteria are objective and non-negotiable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support for open standards including IMAP and SMTP</li>
<li>Support for users who wish to bring their own domain</li>
</ol>
<p>This is necessary to preserve the user&rsquo;s ownership of their data by making it
accessible over open and standardized protocols, and their right to move to
another service provider by not fixing their identity to a domain name
controlled by the email provider. It is for these reasons that Posteo,
ProtonMail, and Tutanota are not considered suitable.</p>
<p>The remaining criteria are subjective:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the business conducted ethically? Are their incentives aligned with their
customers, or with their investors?</li>
<li>Is it sustainable? Can I expect them to be around in 10 years? 20? 30?</li>
<li>Do they make unfounded claims about security or privacy, or develop
techniques which ultimately rely on trusting them instead of supporting or
improving standards which rely on encryption?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>If they make claims about privacy or security, do they explain the
limitations and trade-offs, or do they let you believe it&rsquo;s infallible?</li>
<li>Do you trust them with your personal data? What if they&rsquo;re compelled by law
enforcement? What is their government like?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Bonus points:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is their relationship with open source?</li>
<li>Can I sign up without an existing email address? Is there a chicken and egg
problem here?<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li>How well do they handle plaintext email? Do they meet the criteria for
recommended clients at
<a href="https://useplaintext.email/#implementation-recommendations">useplaintext.email</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you represent a mail service provider which you believe meets this criteria,
please <a href="mailto:sir@cmpwn.com">send me an email</a>.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This also rules out ProtonMail and Tutanota, doubly damning them, especially because it provides an excuse for skipping IMAP and SMTP, which conveniently enables vendor lock-in. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This rules out Fastmail because of their government (Australia)&rsquo;s hostile and subversive laws regarding encryption. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Alarmingly rare, this one. It seems to be either this, or a captcha like mailbox.org does. I would be interested in seeing the use of client-side proof of work, or requiring someone to enter their payment details and successfully complete a charge instead. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
