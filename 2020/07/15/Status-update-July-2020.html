    <p>Hello again! Another month of FOSS development behind us, and we&rsquo;re back again
to share the results. I took a week off at the end of June, so my progress this
month is somewhat less than usual. Regardless, I have some updates for you,
mainly in the domain of SourceHut work.</p>
<p>But before we get to that, let&rsquo;s go over this month&rsquo;s small victories. One was
the invention of the <a href="https://baremessages.org">BARE message format</a>, which I
wrote <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/06/21/BARE-message-encoding.html">a blog post about</a> if you want to learn more. Since that
article, five new implementations have appeared from various authors: Rust,
Python, JavaScript, D, and Zig.</p>
<p>I also wrote a couple of not-blogposts for this site (drewdevault.com),
including a page <a href="/dynlib">dispelling misconceptions about static linking</a>,
and a page (that I hope you&rsquo;ll contribute to!) with <a href="/editing">videos of people editing
text</a>. Just dropping a link here in case you missed them; they didn&rsquo;t
appear in RSS and aren&rsquo;t blog posts. To help find random stuff like that on this
site, I&rsquo;ve also established a <a href="/misc">misc page</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, on to SourceHut. Perhaps the most exciting development is the addition of
<a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2020-07-14-setting-up-ci-for-mailing-lists/">continuous integration to the mailing lists</a>. I&rsquo;ve been working
towards this for some time now, and it&rsquo;s the first of many features which are
now possible thanks to the addition of the project hub. I intend to complete
some follow-up work improving the CI feature further still in the coming weeks.
I&rsquo;m also planning an upgrade for the hardware that runs hg.sr.ht during the same
timeframe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all the news I have for now, somewhat less than usual. Some time off was
much-needed, though. Thanks for your continued support, and I hope you continue
to enjoy using my software!</p>
