    <p>pkg.go.dev sucks. It&rsquo;s certainly <em>prettier</em> than godoc.org, but under the
covers, it&rsquo;s a failure of engineering characteristic of the Google approach.</p>
<p>Go is a <em>pretty good</em> programming language. I have long held that this is not
attributable to Google&rsquo;s stewardship, but rather to a small number of language
designers and a clear line of influences which is drawn entirely from outside of
Google — mostly from Bell Labs. pkg.go.dev provides renewed support for my
argument: it has all the hallmarks of Google crapware and none of the
deliberate, good engineering work that went into Go&rsquo;s design.</p>
<p>It was apparent from the start that this is what it would be. pkg.go.dev was
launched as a closed-source product,
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/pkg.go.dev-2020">justified</a> by pointing out that
godoc.org is too complex to run on an intranet, and pkg.go.dev has the same
problem. There are many problems to take apart in this explanation: the
assumption that the only reason an open source platform is desirable is for
running it on your intranet; the unstated assumption that such complexity
is necessary or agreeable in the first place; and the
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25443">systemic</a> <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30029">erosion</a>
of the existing (and simple!) tools which <em>could</em> have been used for this
purpose prior to this change. The attitude towards open source was only changed
following pkg.go.dev&rsquo;s harsh reception by the community.</p>
<p>But this attitude <em>did</em> change, and it is open-source now<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, so let&rsquo;s give
them credit for that. The good intentions are spoilt by the fact that pkg.go.dev
fetches the list of modules from <a href="https://proxy.golang.org/">proxy.golang.org</a>:
a closed-source proxy through which all of your go module fetches are being
routed and tracked (oh, you didn&rsquo;t know? They never told you, after all).
Anyway, enough of the gross disregard for the values of open source and user
privacy; I <em>do</em> have some technical problems to talk about.</p>
<p>One concern comes from a blatant failure to comprehend the fundamentally
decentralized nature of git hosting. Thankfully, git.sr.ht is supported now<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
— but only <em>the</em> git.sr.ht, i.e. the hosted instance, not the software.
pkg.go.dev hard-codes a list of centralized git hosting services, and completely
disregards the idea of git hosting as <em>software</em> rather than as a <em>platform</em>.
Any GitLab instance other than gitlab.com (such as
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org">gitlab.freedesktop.org</a> or
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/public">salsa.debian.org</a>); any
<a href="https://gogs.io/">Gogs</a> or <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a> like
<a href="https://codeberg.org">Codeberg</a>; cgit instances like
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/">git.kernel.org</a>; none of these are going to work
unless every host is added and the list is kept up-to-date manually. Your
intranet instance of cgit? Not a chance.</p>
<p>They were also given an opportunity here to fix a long-standing problem with Go
package discovery, namely that it requires every downstream git repository host
has to (1) provide a web interface and (2) include <em>Go-specific</em> meta tags in
the HTML. The hubris to impose your <em>programming language</em>&rsquo;s needs onto a
language-agnostic version control system! I asked: they have no interest in the
better-engineered — but more worksome — approach of pursing a
language agnostic design.</p>
<p>The worldview of the developers is whack, the new site introduces dozens of
regressions, and all it really improves upon is the visual style — which
could trivially have been done to godoc.org. The goal is shipping a shiny new
product — not engineering a good solution. This is typical of Google&rsquo;s
engineering ethos in general. pkg.go.dev sucks, and is added the large (and
growing) body of evidence that Google is bad for Go.</p>
