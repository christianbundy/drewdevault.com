    <p>GitHub took a note out of the Microsoft &ldquo;<abbr title="Embrace, Extend,
Extinguish">EEE</abbr>&rdquo; playbook when designing their git services. They
<strong>embraced</strong> git, and then rather than building an interface on top of email
— the collaboration mechanism that git was designed to use, and which is
still used for Linux kernel development<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — they built their &ldquo;pull
requests&rdquo; mechanism.</p>
<p>They took terminology which already had meaning — &ldquo;fork&rdquo;, meaning the
creation a separate governing body and development upstream for a codebase, a
rather large task; and &ldquo;pull request&rdquo;, a git workflow which prepares an email
asking a receipient to pull a large branch of changes from a non-centralized
source — and replaced these decentralized, open systems with a completely
incompatible system designed to keep you on GitHub and to teach you to
collaborate using GitHub&rsquo;s proprietary tools. They <strong>extended</strong> git in a
proprietary way.</p>
<p>Microsoft knows a good deal when they see one, and picked up GitHub for a cool
$7,500,000,000, after they had already completed the two steps in Microsoft&rsquo;s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">anti-open-source playbook</a>. They joined the Linux Foundation in late 2016,
after Azure failed to win people back to Windows Server, admitting defeat while
simultaneously carving out a space from which they could project their interests
over the kernel.</p>
<p>Today, I discovered this article, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/">Relying on plain-text email is a
&lsquo;barrier to entry&rsquo; for kernel development, says Linux Foundation board
member</a>&rdquo;, a title which conveniently chooses to refer to Sarah Novotny by
her role as a Linux Foundation board member, rather than by her full title,
&ldquo;Sarah Novotny, Microsoft employee, transitive owner of GitHub, and patroness
saint of conflicts of interests.&rdquo; Finally, they&rsquo;re playing the <strong>extinguish</strong>
card. Naturally, a representative of Microsoft, a company which has long waged
war against open source, and GitHub, a company which explicitly built an
incompatible proprietary system to extend git, would have an interest in
dismantling the distributed, open system that git was designed for.</p>
<p>I represent <a href="https://sourcehut.org">sourcehut</a>, a GitHub competitor which does
what GitHub wouldn&rsquo;t — interoperate with open, distributed protocols, and
in the form of 100% free and open-source software. I agree that the UX of
email-driven development could be better! But instead of investing $7.5B into
throwing the baby out with the bathwater, we&rsquo;ve <a href="https://git-send-email.io/">built interactive
tutorials</a>, <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~emersion/mrsh-dev/patches/4728">designed better mailing lists</a>, <a href="https://sr.ht/_fUk.webm">built web interfaces for
patch submission</a>, <a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2020-07-14-setting-up-ci-for-mailing-lists/">implemented CI for emails</a> and <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commits?author=ddevault">sent improvements to
git upstream</a>. I wrote <a href="https://aerc-mail.org/">an entire mail client which makes it easier to use
these tools</a>. We&rsquo;re planning on web-based review interface, too. The result
is a UX which provides a similar experience to GitHub, but without disrupting
the established open ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is how you improve the ecosystem, Microsoft. Take notes. Stick with the
embrace, move your extending <em>upstream</em>, and forget about extinguish.</p>
