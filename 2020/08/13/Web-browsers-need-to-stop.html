    <p>Enough is enough.</p>
<p>The web and web browsers have become Lovecraftian horrors of an unprecedented
scale. They&rsquo;ve long since left &ldquo;scope creep&rdquo; territory and entered &ldquo;oh my god
please just stop&rdquo; territory, and are trucking on through to hitherto unexplored
degrees of <em>obscene</em> scope. And we <em>don&rsquo;t want</em> what they&rsquo;re selling. Google
pitches garbage like AMP<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and pushing dubious half-assed specs like Web
Components. Mozilla just fired everyone relevant<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to focus on crap no one
asked for like Pocket, and fad nonsense like a paid VPN service and <del>virtual
reality tech</del>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <em>[2020-08-14: It has been pointed out that the VR team was
also fired.]</em></p>
<p>Microsoft gave up entirely. Mozilla just hammered the last few nails into their
casket.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> <del>Safari is a joke</del><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Google is all that&rsquo;s left, and they&rsquo;re
<em>not</em> a good steward of the open web. The browsers are drowning under their own
scope.  The web is dead.</p>
<p>I call for an immediate and indefinite suspension of the addition of new
developer-facing APIs to web browsers. Browser vendors need to start thinking
about <em>reducing</em> scope and <em>cutting</em> features. WebUSB, WebBluetooth, WebXR,
<del>WebDRM</del> <del>WebMPAA</del> <del>WebBootlicking</del> <del>replacing User-Agent with
Vendor-Agent cause let&rsquo;s be honest with ourselves at this point</del> &ldquo;Encrypted
Media Extensions&rdquo; — this crap all needs to go. At some point you need to
stop adding scope and start focusing on performance, efficiency, reliability,
and security<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> at the scope you already have.</p>
<p>Enough is enough.</p>

<p><em>No one</em> wants AMP. Google knows it, you know it, I know it. If you&rsquo;re a Google engineer who is still working on AMP, you are a disgrace to your field. <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/05/05/We-are-complicit-in-our-employers-deeds.html">Take responsibility for the code you write</a>. This project needs to be dead and buried and the earth above salted, and it needs to happen yesterday. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><del>No layoffs or pay cuts at the management level, of course!</del> It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re <em>responsible</em> for these problems, it&rsquo;s not like anyone&rsquo;s fucking <em>responsible</em> for any of this, it&rsquo;s not like the very idea of <em>personal responsibility</em> has been forgotten by both executives and engineers, no sir! <em>[2020-08-14: It has been pointed out that some VPs were laid off. I also wish to clarify that the personal responsibility I find absent at the engineering level is more of a commentary on Google than Mozilla.]</em> <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Oh good, the <em>web</em> is exactly what VR needs! It&rsquo;s definitely <em>not</em> a huge time-sink requiring the highly skilled low-level engineering talent which Mozilla just finished <em>laying off</em>, or years of effort and millions of dollars just to realize that the new state of the art is still just an expensive and underwhelming product whose few end-user applications make half of their users motion sick. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Next time they should aim for their executive&rsquo;s heads, maybe they&rsquo;ll jostle them around enough to get the two wires in each of their heads to make contact so that they&rsquo;re briefly capable of making basic decisions and not just collecting multi-million-dollar paychecks. <a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>2020-08-14: I haven&rsquo;t used Safari in over 10 years, so maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad. However, so long as it&rsquo;s single-platform and closed source, it&rsquo;s still a net negative on the ecosystem. <a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The web <em>might</em> be one for four on these right now. <a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
