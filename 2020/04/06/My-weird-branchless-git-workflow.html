    <p>I have been using git for a while, and I took the time to learn about it in
great detail. Equipped with an understanding of its internals and a comfortable
familiarity with tools like <a href="https://git-rebase.io">git rebase</a> — and a
personal, intrinsic desire to strive for minimal and lightweight solutions
— I have organically developed a workflow which is, admittedly, somewhat
unorthodox.</p>
<p>In short, I use git branches very rarely, preferring to work on my local master
branch almost every time. When I want to work on multiple tasks in the same
repository (i.e. often), I just&hellip; work on all of them on master. I waste no
time creating a new branch, or switching to another branch to change contexts; I
just start writing code and committing changes, all directly on master,
intermixing different workstreams freely.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This reduces my startup time to
zero, both for starting new tasks and revisiting old work.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m ready to present some or all of my changes to upstream, I grab git
rebase and reorganize all of these into their respective features, bugfixes, and
so on, forming a series of carefully organized, self-contained patchsets. When I
receive feedback, I just start correcting the code right away, then fixup the
old commits during the rebase. Often, I&rsquo;ll bring the particular patchset I&rsquo;m
ready to present upstream to the front of my master branch at the same time, for
convenient access with <a href="https://git-send-email.io">git send-email</a>.</p>
<p>I generally set my local master branch to track the remote master branch,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> so
I can update my branch with <code>git pull --rebase</code>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Because all of my
work-in-progress features are on the master branch, this allows me to quickly
address any merge conflicts with upstream for <em>all</em> of my ongoing work at once.
Additionally, by keeping them all on the same branch, I can be assured that my
patches are mutually applicable and that there won&rsquo;t be any surprise conflicts
in feature B after feature A is merged upstream.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m working on my own projects (where I can push to upstream master), I&rsquo;ll
still be working on master. If I end up with a few commits queued up and I need
to review some incoming patches, I&rsquo;ll just apply them to master, rebase them
behind my WIP work, and then use <code>git push origin HEAD~5:refs/heads/master</code> to
send them upstream, or something to that effect.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Bonus: this instantly
rebases my WIP work on top of the new master branch.</p>
<p>This workflow saves me time in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>No time spent creating new branches for new features.</li>
<li>No time spent switching between branches to address feedback.</li>
<li>All of my features are guaranteed to be mutually applicable to master, saving
me time addressing conflicts.</li>
<li>Any conflicts with upstream are addressed in all of my workstreams at once,
without switching between branches or allowing any branch to get stale.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that lightweight branches are one of git&rsquo;s flagship features, but I don&rsquo;t
really use them. I know it&rsquo;s weird, sue me.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do use branches, though, when I know that a workstream is going to
be a lot of work — it involves lots of large-scale refactoring, or will
take several weeks to complete. This isolates it from my normal workflow on
small-to-medium patches, acknowledging that the large workstream is going to be
more prone to conflicts. By addressing these separately, I don&rsquo;t waste my time
fixing up the error-prone branch all the time while I&rsquo;m working on my smaller
workstreams.</p>

<p>I will occasionally use <code>git add -p</code> or even just <code>git commit -p</code> to quickly separate any changes in my working directory into separate commits for their respective workstreams, to make my life easier later on. This is usually the case when, for example, I have to fix problem A before I can address problem B, and additional issues with problem A are revealed by my work on problem B. I just fix them right away, <code>git commit -p</code> the changes separately, then file each commit into their respective patchsets later. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Okay, so in git, you have <em>local</em> branches and <em>remote</em> branches.  The default behavior is reasonably sane, so I would forgive you for not noticing. Your local branches can <em>track</em> remote branches, so that when you <code>git pull</code> it automatically updates any local <em>tracking branches</em>. <code>git pull</code> is actually equivalent to doing <code>git fetch</code> and then <code>git merge origin/master</code> assuming that the current branch (your <em>local</em> master) is <em>tracking</em> <code>origin/master</code>. <code>git pull --rebase</code> is the same thing, except it uses <code>git rebase</code> instead of <code>git merge</code> to update your local branch. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>In fact, I have <code>pull.rebase = true</code> in my git config, which makes <code>--rebase</code> the default behavior. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Okay, so <code>git push</code> is shorthand for <code>git push origin master</code>, if you have a tracking branch set up for your local master branch to <code>origin/master</code>. But this itself is also shorthand, for <code>git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;local&gt;:&lt;remote&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;local&gt;</code> is the local branch you want to push, and <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> is the remote branch you want to update. But, remember that branches are just references to commits. In git, there are other ways to reference commits. <code>HEAD~5</code>, for example, gets the commit which is 5 commits earlier than <code>HEAD</code>, which is the commit you have checked out right now. So <code>git push origin HEAD~5:refs/for/master</code> updates the <code>origin</code>&rsquo;s <code>refs/for/master</code> reference (i.e. the master branch) to the local commit at <code>HEAD~5</code>, pushing any commits that upstream master doesn&rsquo;t also have in the process. <a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
