    <p>A mercifully cool September is upon us, and after years of searching, I finally
was able to secure Club Mate in the US. Let&rsquo;s decant a bottle and recant the
story of this month&rsquo;s progress in free software development.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;ve been able to put a pin on operations work on SourceHut for
the time being, and focus again on its software development. The GraphQL APIs
are a major focus area here, and I&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress towards OAuth 2.0
support and writable GraphQL APIs. Additionally, I&rsquo;ve laid out a number of
prioritized tickets for the beta — with the &ldquo;beta&rdquo; label on todo.sr.ht
— and have been picking items off of the list one at a time, mainly
focusing on meta.sr.ht improvements at first. I&rsquo;ll go into more detail in the
What&rsquo;s Cooking post for SourceHut later today, stay tuned.</p>
<p>There has been some advancements in the little projects: a second Python
implementation of BARE has appeared, another in Common Lisp, and one in PHP;
bringing the total implementations to nine. We have a pretty decent spread of
support among programming languages!</p>
<p>Not much more news to share today. Been focusing in on SourceHut and a secret
project, so check out the What&rsquo;s Cooking post for more details. Thanks for your
support!</p>
