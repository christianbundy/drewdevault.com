    <p>I drove a car daily for many years while I was living in Colorado, California,
and New Jersey, but since I moved to Philadelphia I have not needed a car. The
public transit here is not great, but it&rsquo;s good enough to get where I need to be
and it&rsquo;s a lot easier than worrying about parking a car. However, in the past
couple of years, I have been moving more and more large server parts back and
forth to the datacenter for SourceHut. I&rsquo;ve also developed an interest in
astronomy, which benefits from being able to carry large equipment to remote
places. These reasons, among others, put me into the market for a vehicle once
again.</p>
<p>I think of a vehicle strictly as a functional tool. Some creature comforts are
nice, but I consider them optional. Instead, I prioritize utility. A truck makes
a lot of sense — lots of room to carry things in. And, given my expected
driving schedule of &ldquo;not often&rdquo;, I wasn&rsquo;t looking to spend a lot of money or
get a loan. There are other concerns: modern cars are very complicated machines,
and many have lots of proprietary computerized components which make end-user
maintenance very difficult. Sometimes manufacturers even use cryptography and
legal threats to bring cars into their dealerships, bullying out third-party
repairs.</p>
<p>To avoid these, I got an older truck: a 1984 Dodge D250. It&rsquo;s a much simpler
machine than most modern cars, and learning how to repair and maintain it is
something I can do in my spare time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an old truck, and the previous owners were not negligent, but also didn&rsquo;t
invest a lot of time or money in the vehicle&rsquo;s upkeep. The first problem I hit
was the turn signal lever snapping and becoming slack, which I fixed by pulling
open the steering column, re-aligning the lever, and tightening an internal
screw. The more interesting problem, however, was this:</p>
<p><img src="https://l.sr.ht/OWVw.jpg" alt="Picture of a broken latch on the window over the truck bay"></p>
<p>This plastic part holds an arm in place, which is engaged by a lever in the
center of the window which folds closed over the truck bay. It&rsquo;s used to hold
the window in place and provides a weak locking mechanism. When the arm is
allowed to move freely, it can clang around while I&rsquo;m driving, and can make
opening the truck bay a frustrating procedure. I have been looking for a reason
to learn how to use <a href="http://solvespace.com/index.pl">solvespace</a>, and this
seemed like a great start.</p>
<p>I ordered a caliper<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and measured the dimensions of the broken part, and took
pictures of it from several angles for later reference. I took some notes:</p>
<p><img src="https://l.sr.ht/20eR.jpg" alt="Picture of my notes on the measurements of the part"></p>
<p>Then, I used solvespace to design the following part:</p>
<p><img src="https://l.sr.ht/rVPV.png" alt="Screenshot of the replacement part in solvespace"></p>
<p>This was the third iteration — I printed one version, brought it out to
the truck to compare with the broken part, made refinements to the design, then
rinse and repeat. Here&rsquo;s an earlier revision being compared with the broken
piece:</p>
<p><img src="https://l.sr.ht/CUPM.jpg" alt="A hand holds up a 3D printed part for comparison with the original"></p>
<p>Finally, I arrived at a design I liked and sent it to the printer.</p>
<p><img src="https://l.sr.ht/xh9h.jpg" alt="Picture of my 3D printer working on the part"></p>
<p>I took some pliers to the remaining plastic bits from the broken part, and sawed
off the rivets. I attached the replacement with superglue and ta-da!</p>
<p><img src="https://l.sr.ht/3AGi.jpg" alt="Picture of the replacement part in place"></p>
<p>If the glue fails, I&rsquo;ll drill out what&rsquo;s left of the rivets and secure it with
screws. This may require another revision of the design, which will also give me
a chance to address some minor shortcomings. I don&rsquo;t expect to need this,
though, because this is not part under especially high stress.</p>
<p>You can get the CAD files and an STL from my <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/open-dodge-d250">repository
here</a>, which I intend to keep
updating as I learn more about this truck and encounter more fun problems to
solve.</p>
