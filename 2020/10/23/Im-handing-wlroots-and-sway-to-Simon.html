    <p>Over the past several months, I&rsquo;ve been gradually weaning down my role in both
projects, and as a contributor to Wayland in general. I feel that I&rsquo;ve already
accomplished everything I set out to do with Wayland — and more! I have
been happily using sway as my daily driver for well over a year with no
complaints or conspicuously absent features. For me, there&rsquo;s little reason to
stay involved. This will likely come as no surprise to many who&rsquo;ve kept their
ear to the ground in these communities.</p>
<p>Simon has been an important co-maintainer on wlroots and sway for several years,
and also serves as a maintainer for Wayland itself, and Weston. I trust him with
these projects, and he&rsquo;s been doing a stellar job so far — no real change
in his work is necessary for this hand-off. Simon works for SourceHut full-time
and his compensation covers his role in the Wayland community, so you can trust
that the health of the project is unaffected, too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still plenty of great things to come from these projects without me.
Many improvements are underway and more are planned for the future. Don&rsquo;t worry:
sway and wlroots have already demonstrated that they work quite well without my
active involvement.</p>
<p>Good luck, Simon, and thanks for all of your hard work! I&rsquo;m proud of you!</p>
