    <p>I&rsquo;m writing this month&rsquo;s status update from a brand-new desktop workstation
(well, I re-used the GPU), my first new workstation in about 10 years. I hope
this new one lasts for another decade! I aimed for something smaller and
lightweight this time — it&rsquo;s a Mini-ITX build. I&rsquo;ve only been running this
for a few days, so let me tell you about the last few accomplishments which are
accountable to my venerable workstation&rsquo;s final days of life.</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;s been a ton of important work completed for SourceHut&rsquo;s API 2.0
plans. All of the main blockers for the first version of meta.sr.ht&rsquo;s writable
GraphQL API are resolved, and after implementing a few more resolvers it should
be in a shippable state. This included riggings for database transactions,
simplification of the mini-&ldquo;ORM&rdquo; I built, and support for asyncronous work like
delivering webhooks. The latter called for a new library, <a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/dowork/">dowork</a>,
which you&rsquo;re free to reuse to bring asyncronous work processing to your Go
programs.</p>
<p>I also built a new general-purpose daemon for SourceHut called
<a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/chartsrv/">chartsrv</a>, which can be used to generate graphs from
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> data. The following is a real-time graph of the load
average on the builds.sr.ht workers:</p>
<p><img src="https://metrics.sr.ht/chart.svg?title=Build%20worker%20load%20average&amp;query=avg_over_time%28node_load15%7Binstance%3D~%22cirno%5B0-9%5D%2B.sr.ht%3A80%22%7D%5B1h%5D%29&amp;max=64&amp;since=336h&amp;stacked&amp;step=10000&amp;height=3&amp;width=10" alt="A chart which hopefully shows a reasonable load average across all workers"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting more into <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a> this month, and have completed
three (or four?) whole projects for it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gmni/">gmni</a> and gmnlm: a client implementation and line-mode browser</li>
<li><a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gmnisrv/">gmnisrv</a>: a server implementation</li>
<li><a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/kineto/">kineto</a>: an HTTP-&gt;Gemini portal</li>
</ul>
<p>The (arguably) fourth project is the completion of a Gemini version of this
blog, which is available at <code>gemini://drewdevault.com</code>, or via the kineto portal
at <a href="https://portal.drewdevault.com">portal.drewdevault.com</a>. I&rsquo;ll be posting
some content exclusively on Gemini (and I already have!), so get yourself a
client if you want to tune in.</p>
<p>I have also invested some effort into <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/himitsu">himitsu</a>, a project I shelved
for so long that you probably don&rsquo;t remember it. Worry not, I have rewritten the
README.md to give you a better introduction to it. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot for your
viewing pleasure:</p>
<p><img src="https://l.sr.ht/hr4G.png" alt="A GUI dialog asking a user to consent to allow an application to access their IMAP credentials"></p>
<p>Bonus update: two new <a href="https://baremessages.org">BARE</a> implementations have
appeared: OCaml and Java.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now! I&rsquo;ll see you for the next update soon. Thanks for your
support!</p>
