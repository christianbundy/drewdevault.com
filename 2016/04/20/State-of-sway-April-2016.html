  <article>
    <p>Since the previous <a href="/2015/12/20/State-of-sway.html">State of Sway</a>, we have
accomplished quite a bit. We are now shipping versioned releases of sway, which
include support for window borders, input device configuration, more new
features, and many bug fixes and stability improvements. I&rsquo;m also happy to say
that Sway 0.5 has landed in the Arch Linux community repository and I&rsquo;m starting
to hear rumors of it landing in other Linux distros as well. Here&rsquo;s a quick
rundown of what&rsquo;s happened in the past four months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Window borders work now</li>
<li>Input devices are configurable</li>
<li>swaybar is much more mature, including support for i3status and i3blocks</li>
<li>swaylock has reached a similar level of maturity</li>
<li>New <code>include</code> config command to include sub-configs</li>
<li>We have a <a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/blob/master/assets/Sway_Wallpaper_Blue_1920x1080.png">default wallpaper</a> and a logo now</li>
<li>musl libc support has been added</li>
<li>More features of the i3 IPC protocol have been implemented</li>
<li>18 more i3 commands have been implemented</li>
<li>Many improvements to documentation</li>
<li>Hundreds of bug fixes and small improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a particularly big fan of the new include command, which allows me to add
this to my config file:</p>
<pre><code>include ~/.config/sway/config.d/`hostname`/*
</code></pre>
<p>The net of this is that it includes a set of configs specific to each machine I
run Sway on, which each have a unique output device &amp; input device configuration
and several other details, but I can include them all under
<a href="https://gogs.sr.ht/SirCmpwn/dotfiles">version control</a> to keep my dotfiles
synced between computers.</p>
<p>Today, sway looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://sr.ht/me1j.png"><img src="https://sr.ht/me1j.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now making our way towards Sway 1.0. I have put together a roadmap of the
things we have done and the things that remain to do for Sway 1.0, which is
available on the improved website <a href="http://swaywm.org/roadmap">here</a>. We are
still now moving forward on many of these features, including the most asked for
feature: the stacked &amp; tabbed window layouts, which is under development from
Mikkel Oscar Lyderik. He&rsquo;s given me this screenshot to tease you with:</p>
<p><img src="https://sr.ht/0CkR.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All of this is only possible thanks to the hard work of dozens of contributors.
Here&rsquo;s the breakdown of <strong>lines of code per author</strong> for the top ten authors
(with the difference from the previous State of Sway in parenthesis):</p>
<table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>4307 (+3180)</td><td>Mikkel Oscar Lyderik</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3059 (-457)</td><td>Drew DeVault</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2285 (+115)</td><td>taiyu</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1826 (+40)</td><td>S. Christoffer Eliesen</td></tr>
        <tr><td>682 (-38)</td><td>Luminarys</td></tr>
        <tr><td>544 (+544)</td><td>Cole Mickens</td></tr>
        <tr><td>515 (-19)</td><td>minus</td></tr>
        <tr><td>385 (+185)</td><td>Christoph Gysin</td></tr>
        <tr><td>345 (+266)</td><td>Kevin Hamacher</td></tr>
        <tr><td>166 (+45)</td><td>crondog</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Once again, I&rsquo;m no longer the author of the most lines of code. Sway now
has a grand total of 15,422 lines of C and 2,787 lines of headers. Here&rsquo;s the
total <strong>number of commits per author</strong> for each of the top 10
committers:</p>
<table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>688</td><td> Drew DeVault</td></tr>
        <tr><td>212</td><td> Mikkel Oscar Lyderik</td></tr>
        <tr><td>191</td><td> taiyu</td></tr>
        <tr><td>109</td><td> S. Christoffer Eliesen</td></tr>
        <tr><td>97</td><td> Luminarys</td></tr>
        <tr><td>58</td><td> Christoph Gysin</td></tr>
        <tr><td>34</td><td> minus</td></tr>
        <tr><td>18</td><td> crondog</td></tr>
        <tr><td>13</td><td> Yacine Hmito</td></tr>
        <tr><td>12</td><td> progandy</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>As the maintainer of sway, <em>a lot</em> of what I do is reviewing and merging
contributions from others. So these statistics change a bit if we use <strong>number
of commits per author, excluding merge commits</strong>:</p>
<table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>343</td><td> Drew DeVault</td></tr>
        <tr><td>201</td><td> Mikkel Oscar Lyderik</td></tr>
        <tr><td>175</td><td> taiyu</td></tr>
        <tr><td>109</td><td> S. Christoffer Eliesen</td></tr>
        <tr><td>96</td><td> Luminarys</td></tr>
        <tr><td>58</td><td> Christoph Gysin</td></tr>
        <tr><td>34</td><td> minus</td></tr>
        <tr><td>18</td><td> crondog</td></tr>
        <tr><td>13</td><td> Yacine Hmito</td></tr>
        <tr><td>12</td><td> progandy</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>These stats only cover the top ten in each, but there are more - check out the
<a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/graphs/contributors">full list</a>. Hopefully
next time I write a blog post like this, we&rsquo;ll be well into the lifetime of Sway
1.0!</p>
