<p>I used Google for a long time, but have waned myself off of it over the past
few years, and I finally deleted my account a little over a month ago. I feel so
much better about my privacy now that I&rsquo;ve removed Google from the equation, and
self hosting my things affords me a lot of flexibility and useful customizations.</p>
<h2 id="mailcmpwncom">mail.cmpwn.com</h2>
<p>This one was the most difficult and time consuming to set up, but it was <em>very</em>
worth it. I&rsquo;ve intended for a while to make a new mail server software suite
that&rsquo;s less terrible to set up, so hopefully that situation will improve in the
future. I want to flesh out <a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/aerc">aerc</a> some more
first. A personal mail server was one of the earliest things I set up in my
post-Google life - I&rsquo;ve operated it for about two years now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Postfix to handle incoming and outgoing mail</li>
<li>Dovecot to handle mail delivery, filtering, and IMAP</li>
<li>Postfixadmin to provide a nice interface for managing accounts</li>
<li>mutt to read and compose my emails on the desktop</li>
<li>K9 to read and compose my emails on Android</li>
<li>Roundcube for when it&rsquo;s occasionally necessary to read an HTML email</li>
</ul>
<p>With my mail server provides a lot of side benefits, too. For one, all of my
email-sending software now uses it. Once Mandrill went kaput, it was easy to
switch everything over to it. I can be sending and receiving email from a new
domain in less than 5 minutes now. Using sieve scripts for filtering emails is
also a lot more flexible than what Google offered - I now have filtering set up
to organize several mailing lists, alerts and notifications sent by my software
and servers, RSS feeds, and more.</p>
<p>My strategy for defeating spam is to use a combination of the spamhaus
blocklist, greylisting, and blacklisting with sieve. I see about 3-5 spam emails
per week on average with this setup. To ensure my own emails get delivered, I&rsquo;ve
set up SPF and DKIM, reverse DNS, and appealed to have my IP address removed
from blocklists. A great tool in figuring all this out has been
<a href="http://mail-tester.com">mail-tester.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="youtube">YouTube</h2>
<p>For YouTube, I &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; to channels by adding their RSS feeds to
<a href="http://www.allthingsrss.com/rss2email/">rss2email</a>, combined with sieve scripts
that filter them into a specific folder. I then have a keybinding in mutt that,
when pressed, pulls the YouTube URL out of an email and feeds it to mpv, a
desktop video player. It&rsquo;s so much easier to access YouTube this way than
through the web browser - no ads, familiar keybindings, remote control support,
and a no-nonsense feed of your videos.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Instead of Google Music, Spotify, or anything else, I run an internet radio
with my friends. We all keep our music collections (mostly lossless) on NFS
servers, and we mounted these servers on a streaming server that shuffles the
entire thing and keeps a searchable database of music. We have an API that I
pull from to integrate desktop keybindings and a status line on my taskbar, and
an IRC bot for searching the database and requesting songs. I can also stream to
my phone with VLC, as well as use scripts to maintain an offline archive of my
favorite songs. This setup is <em>way</em> nicer than any commercial service I&rsquo;ve used
in the past. We&rsquo;ll be open sourcing version 2 to provide a turnkey solution for
this type of self-hosted music service.</p>
<h2 id="web-search">Web search</h2>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>. Even if you think the search results
aren&rsquo;t up to snuff (you get used to just being a bit more specific anyway), the
bangs feature is absolutely indispensable. I recently patched Chromium for
Android to support DuckDuckGo as a search engine as well:
<a href="https://sr.ht/h4bZ.patch">here&rsquo;s the patch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="file-hosting">File hosting</h2>
<p>Instead of using Google Drive, I&rsquo;m using a number of different solutions
depending on what&rsquo;s most convenient at the time. I operate
<a href="https://sr.ht">sr.ht</a> for me and my friends, which allows me to just have a
place to drop a file and get a link to share. I have scripts and keybindings set
up to make uploading files here second nature, as well as an Android app someone
wrote. I also keep a 128G flash drive on my keychain now that comes in handy all
the time, and a big-ass file server on OVH that I keep mounted with NFS or sshfs
depending on the scenario, and sometimes I just stash files on a random server
with rsync. sr.ht is <a href="https://gogs.sr.ht/SirCmpwn/sr.ht">open source</a>, by the
way.</p>
<h2 id="cyanogenmod">CyanogenMod</h2>
<p>On Android, I use CyanogenMod without Google Play Services, and I use F-Droid to
get apps. When I used Google Now, I found that I most often just asked it for
reminders, which I now do via an open source app called Notable Plus. I also
have open source apps for reading HN, downloading torrents, blocking ads,
connecting to IRC, two factor authentication, YouTube, password management,
Twitter, and more.</p>
<h2 id="notably-missing-docs">Notably missing: Docs</h2>
<p>Hopefully the new LibreOffice thing will do the trick once it&rsquo;s ready. I&rsquo;m
looking forward to that.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-self-host-that-google-doesnt-offer">Things I self host that Google doesn&rsquo;t offer</h2>
<p>I use ZNC to operate an IRC bouncer, which is great because I use IRC <em>a lot</em>.
It keeps logs for me, keeps me always connected, and gives me a number of nice
features to work with. I also host a number of simple websites related to IRC to
do things like channel stats and rules.</p>
<p>To all sr.ht users I offer access to <a href="https://gogs.sr.ht">gogs.sr.ht</a>, which I
personally use to host many private repositories as well as a number of small
projects, and as a kind of staging area for repositories that aren&rsquo;t quite ready
for GitHub yet.</p>
<p>For passwords, I use a tool called <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>, which
encrypts passwords with my PGP key and stores them in a git repository I keep on
gogs.sr.ht, with desktop keybindings to make grabbing them convenient.</p>
<h2 id="help-me-do-this">Help me do this!</h2>
<p>Well, that covers most of my major self hosted services. If you&rsquo;re interested in
more detail about how any of this works so you might set something up yourself,
feel free to reach out to me by <a href="mailto:sir@cmpwn.com">email</a>,
<a href="https://cmpwn.com/@sir">Mastodon</a>, or IRC (SirCmpwn on any network). I&rsquo;d
be happy to help!</p>
