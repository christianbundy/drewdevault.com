    <p>For a long time, it was just setting the default search provider to Google in
exchange for a beefy stipend. Later, paid links in your new tab page were added.
Then, a proprietary service, Pocket, was bundled into the browser - not as an
addon, but a hardcoded feature. In the past few days, we&rsquo;ve discovered an
advertisement in the form of browser extension was sideloaded into user
browsers. Whoever is leading these decisions at Mozilla needs to be stopped.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of what happened a few days ago. Mozilla and NBC
Universal did a &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo; (read: promotion) for the TV show Mr. Robot.
It involved sideloading a sketchy browser extension which will <strong
style="display: inline-block; transform: scaleY(-1)">invert</strong> text that
matches a list of Mr. Robot-related keywords like &ldquo;fsociety&rdquo;, &ldquo;robot&rdquo;, &ldquo;undo&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;fuck&rdquo;, and does a number of other things like adding an HTTP header to
certain sites you visit.</p>
<p>This extension was sideloaded into browsers via the &ldquo;experiments&rdquo; feature.
Not only are these experiments enabled by default, but updates <a href="https://redd.it/7i4puf">have been
known</a> to re-enable it if you turn it off. The
advertisement addon shows up <a href="http://www.bolcer.org/looking-glass2.png">like
this</a> on your addon page, and was
added to Firefox stable. If I saw this before I knew what was going on, I would
think my browser was compromised!  Apparently it was a mistake that this showed
up on the addon page, though - it was supposed to be <em>silently</em> sideloaded into
your browser!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1423003">a ticket</a> on
Bugzilla (Firefox&rsquo;s bug tracker) for discussing this experiment, but it&rsquo;s locked
down and no one outside of Mozilla can see it. There&rsquo;s <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424977">another
ticket</a>, filed by
concerned users, which has since been disabled and had many comments removed,
particularly the angry (but respectful) ones.</p>
<p>Mozilla, this is <strong>not okay</strong>. This is wrong on so many levels. Frankly, whoever
was in charge should be fired over this - which is not something I call for
lightly.</p>
<p>First of all, web browsers are a <em>tool</em>. I don&rsquo;t want my browser to fool around,
I just want it to display websites faithfully. This is the prime directive of
web browsers, and you broke that. When I compile vim with gcc, I don&rsquo;t want
gcc to make vim sporadically add &ldquo;fsociety&rdquo; into every document I write. I want
it to compile vim and go away.</p>
<p>More importantly, these advertising anti-features gravely - perhaps terminally -
violate user trust. This event tells us that &ldquo;Firefox studies&rdquo; into a backdoor
for advertisements, and I will <em>never</em> trust it again. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter -
you&rsquo;re going to re-enable it on the next update. You know what that means? I
will never trust <em>Firefox</em> again. I switched to
<a href="http://qutebrowser.org/">qutebrowser</a> as my daily driver because this crap was
starting to add up, but I still used Firefox from time to time and never
resigned from it entirely or stopped recommending it to friends. Well, whatever
goodwill was left is gone now, and I will only recommend other browsers
henceforth.</p>
<p>Mozilla, you fucked up <em>bad</em>, and you still haven&rsquo;t apologised. The study is
still active and ongoing. There is no amount of money that you should have
accepted for this. This is the last straw - and I took a lot of straws from you.
Goodbye forever, Mozilla.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2017-12-16 @ 22:33</strong></p>
<p>It has been clarified that an about:config flag must be set for this addon&rsquo;s
behavior to be visible. This improves the situation considerably, but I do not
think it exenorates Mozilla and I stand firm behind most of my points. The study
has also been rolled back by Mozilla, and Mozilla has issued
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/mozilla-slipped-a-mr-robot-promo-plugin-into-firefox-1821332254">statements</a>
to the
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/after-blowback-firefox-will-move-mr-robot-extension-t-1821354314">media</a>
justifying the study (no apology has been issued).</p>
<p><strong>Update 2017-12-18</strong></p>
<p>Mozilla has issued an apology:</p>
