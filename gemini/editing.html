I would be interested in adding your video to this page, provided that it
demonstrates one of the following qualities which is not yet represented by
another video:

<ul>
  <li>A natural language not yet represented</li>
  <li>An operating system not yet represented</li>
  <li>A keyboard layout or design not yet represented</li>
  <li>Software with novel editing features</li>
  <li>A novel workflow, e.g. screen reader or dictation software</li>
</ul>

<p>
When preparing your video, please use a camera to capture a video of your
keyboard. I recommend <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> to capture a
recording of both your screen and keyboard, as well as audio from your
microphone. Please narrate your workflow in English, and include details which
seem "obvious" to you; they might not be obvious to someone else. Contact
<a href="mailto:sir@cmpwn.com">Drew DeVault &lt;sir@cmpwn.com&gt;</a>
to list your video. Please include the following details:

<ul>
  <li>Your name, for attribution</li>
  <li>The natural language you are demonstrating input for</li>
  <li>Your keyboard model and layout</li>
  <li>Your operating system and the names &amp; version numbers of your software</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thank you!
