# I'm handing over maintenance of wlroots and sway to Simon Ser

Over the past several months, I've been gradually weaning down my role in both projects, and as a contributor to Wayland in general. I feel that I've already accomplished everything I set out to do with Wayland — and more! I have been happily using sway as my daily driver for well over a year with no complaints or conspicuously absent features. For me, there's little reason to stay involved. This will likely come as no surprise to many who've kept their ear to the ground in these communities.

Simon has been an important co-maintainer on wlroots and sway for several years, and also serves as a maintainer for Wayland itself, and Weston. I trust him with these projects, and he's been doing a stellar job so far — no real change in his work is necessary for this hand-off. Simon works for SourceHut full-time and his compensation covers his role in the Wayland community, so you can trust that the health of the project is unaffected, too.

There's still plenty of great things to come from these projects without me.  Many improvements are underway and more are planned for the future. Don't worry: sway and wlroots have already demonstrated that they work quite well without my active involvement.

Good luck, Simon, and thanks for all of your hard work! I'm proud of you!
