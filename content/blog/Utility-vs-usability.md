In many fields, professional-grade tooling requires a high degree of knowledge
and training to use properly, usually more than is available to the amateur. The
typical mechanic's tool chest makes my (rather well-stocked, in my opinion) tool
bag look quite silly. A racecar driver is using a vehicle which is much more
complex than, say, the soccer mom's mini-van. Professional-grade tools are,
necessarily, more complex and require skill to use.

There are two attributes to consider when classifying these tools: *utility* and
*usability*. These are not the same thing. Some tools have both high utility and
high usability, such as a pencil. Some are highly usable, but of low utility,
such as a child's tricycle. Tools of both low-utility and low-usability are
uncommon, but I'm sure you can think of a few examples from your own experiences
:)

When designing tools, it is important to consider both of these attributes, and
it helps to keep the intended audience in mind. I think that many programmers
today are overly concerned with usability, and insufficiently concerned with
utility. Some programmers (although this sort prefers "developer") go so far as
to fetishize usability *at the expense* of utility.

In some cases, sacrificing utility in favor of usability is an acceptable
trade-off. In the earlier example's case, it's unlikely that anyone would argue
that the soccer mom should be loading the tots into an F1 racecar. However, it's
equally absurd to suppose that the F1 driver should bring a mini-van to the race
track. In the realm of programming, this metaphor speaks most strongly to me in
the design of programming tools.

I argue that most programmers are professionals who are going to invest several
years into learning the craft. This is the audience for whom I design my tools.
What trouble is it to spend an extra hour learning a somewhat less intuitive
[code review tool](https://git-send-email.io) when the programming language
whose code you're reviewing required months to learn and years to master?

[![An XKCD comic which depicts a table that compares "time to improve task" versus "time saved by improvement" and how to figure if the improvement is worthwhile](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time_2x.png)](https://xkcd.com/1205/)

I write tools to maximize the productivity of professional programmers. Ideally,
we can achieve both usability and utility, and often we do just that.
But, sometimes, these tools require a steeper learning curve. If they are *more
useful* in spite of that, they will usually save heaps of time in the long run.

Instead of focusing on dumbing down our tools, maximizing usability at the
expense of utility, we should focus on making powerful tools *and* fostering a
culture of *mentorship*. Senior engineers should be helping their juniors learn
and grow to embrace and build a new generation of more and more productive
tooling, considering usability all the while but never at the expense of
utility.

I'll address mentorship in more detail in future posts. For now, I'll just state
that mentorship is the praxis of my tooling philosophy. We can build better,
more powerful, and more productive tools, even if they require a steeper
learning curve, so long as we're prepared to teach people how to use them, and
they're prepared to learn.
