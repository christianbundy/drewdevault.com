Research conducted on human beings, at least outside of the domain of
technology, has to meet a minimum standard of ethical reasoning called
[informed consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent). Details
vary, but the general elements of informed consent are:

1. Disclosure of the nature and purpose of the research and its implications
   (risks and benefits) for the participant, and the confidentiality of the
   collected information.
2. An adequate understanding of these facts on the part of the participant,
   requiring an accessible explanation in lay terms and an assessment of
   understanding.
3. The participant must exercise voluntary agreement, without coercion or fear
   of repercussions (e.g. not being allowed to use your website).

So, I pose the following question: if your analytics script wouldn't pass muster
at your university's ethics board, then what the hell is it doing on your
website? Can we not meet this basic minimum standard of ethical decency and
respect for our users?

Opt-out is not informed consent. Manually unticking dozens of third-party
trackers from a cookie pop-up is not informed consent. "By continuing to use
this website, you agree to..." is not informed consent. "Install [uBlock
Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)" is not informed consent.

I don't necessarily believe that ethical user tracking is *impossible*, but I
know for damn sure that most of these "pro-privacy" analytics solutions which
have been cropping up in the wake of the GDPR don't qualify, either.

Our industry's fundamental failure to respect users, deliberately mining their
data without consent and without oversight for profit, is the reason why we're
seeing legal crackdowns in the form of the GDPR and similar legislation.  Our
comeuppance is well-earned, and I hope that the regulators give it teeth in
enforcement. The industry response &mdash; denial and looking for ways to weasel
out of these ethical obligations &mdash; is a strategy on borrowed time. The law
is not a computer program, and it is not executed by computers: it is executed
by human beings who can see through your horseshit. You're not going to be able
to seek out some narrow path you can walk to skirt the regulations and keep
spying on people.

You're going to stop spying on people.

*P.S. If you still want the data you might get from analytics without
compromising on ethics, here's an idea: compensate users for their participation
in your research. Woah, what a wild idea! That's not very growth hacker of you,
Drew.*
