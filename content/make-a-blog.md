title: You should make a blog!
---

I would like to see more people writing about their passions and thoughts in a
permanent and public medium. You should make a blog!

**This is an open offer to pay anyone $20 for starting a tech blog and writing
their first article.** If you write another 3 articles within 6 months, I'll
give you another $20. You can also choose to have me donate your reward to one
of the following charitable organizations:

- [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)
- [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/)
- [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/)

<!--
[Send me an email](mailto:sir@cmpwn.com) to claim your reward, with a link to
your blog and PayPal information (or the charitable organization of your
choice).

~~Send me an email~~ to claim your reward, with a link to
your blog and PayPal information (or the charitable organization of your
choice).

<!--
The remaining budget for this blog will accomodate **one** new blog, first come
first served.
-->

**This offer is closed**, as the budget has been expended. Keep an eye out, it
will likely reopen later.

**Details**

- This offer is only available to people who do not already have a blog.
- You must publish on an open-source platform. Medium is not allowed. If you
  want a hosted platform, I recommend [write.as](https://write.as). If you're
  technical, you could build your own blog with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
  or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). GitHub offers [free
  hosting](https://pages.github.com/) for Jekyll-based blogs.
- There's no minimum word count, but put the effort in. Use exactly as many
  words are as necessary to make a substantive point, no fewer and no more.

Join the [Free Writers Club](https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/free-writers-club)
mailing list for updates, reminders to keep writing, and a forum for supporting
each other's work.
