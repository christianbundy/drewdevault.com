      <description>Abstract
 Many people use free software, and a fraction of them have dipped their toes into contributing - publishing their own projects, or contributing to one or two. Too few, however, have completely grokked the opportunities the expansive free software ecosystem offers to us.
This talk will discuss how to contribute to a wider variety of projects, introduce useful tools for quickly coming to grips with a foreign codebase, and explain the mindset that these tools help to cultivate.</description>
