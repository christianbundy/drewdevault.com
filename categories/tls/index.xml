      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on improving the means by which API users authenticate with the SourceHut API. Today, I was reading RFC 6749 (OAuth2) for this purpose, and it got me thinking about the original OAuth spec. I recalled vaguely that it had the API clients actually sign every request, and&amp;hellip; yep, indeed it does. This also got me thinking: what else signs requests? TLS!
OAuth is very complicated. The RFC is 76 pages long, the separate bearer token RFC (6750) is another 18, and no one has ever read either of them.</description>
