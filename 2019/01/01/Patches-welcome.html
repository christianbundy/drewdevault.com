    <p>Happy new year! This is always a weird &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; for me, since all of the fun
happened last night. Today is just kind of&hellip; I guess a chance for everyone to
sober up before work tomorrow? It does tend to invite a sense of reflection and
is the ideal time to plan for the year ahead. One of my goals in 2019 is to
change more people&rsquo;s thinking about the open source community and what it means
to count among their number.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a certain mode of thinking which lends itself to a more
productive free software community and a happier free software contributor. Free
software is not <em>theirs</em> - it&rsquo;s <em>ours</em>. Linux doesn&rsquo;t belong to Linus Torvalds.
Firefox doesn&rsquo;t belong to Mozilla, vim doesn&rsquo;t belong to Bram Moolenaar, and
ffmpeg doesn&rsquo;t belong to Fabrice Bellard. These projects belong to everyone.
That includes you! In this way, we reap the benefits of open source, but we also
shoulder the responsibilities. I&rsquo;m not referring to some abstract sense of
reponsibility, but the tangible ones, like fixing bugs or developing new
features.</p>
<p>One of the great things about this community is how easy it is to release your
software under a FOSS license. You have no obligations to the software once it&rsquo;s
released, except the obligations you hold yourself to (i.e. &ldquo;if this software
makes my computer work, and I want to use my computer, I need to keep this
software in good working order&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s important for users to remember that
they&rsquo;re not entitled to anything other than the rights laid out in the license,
too. You&rsquo;re not entitled to bug fixes or new features - you&rsquo;re <em>empowered</em> by
free software to make those changes yourself.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when working on sway, someone says something like &ldquo;oh, it&rsquo;s a bug in
libwayland&rdquo;. My response is generally along the lines of &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re writing
a libwayland patch then!&rdquo; The goal hasn&rsquo;t changed, only the route. It&rsquo;s no
different from being in the weeds and realizing you need to do some refactoring
first. If a problem in some FOSS project, be it a bug or a conspicuously missing
feature, is in the way of your goals, it&rsquo;s <em>your problem</em>.  A friend of mine
recently said of a missing feature in a project they have nothing to do with:
&ldquo;adding FreeBSD 12 support is not yet done, but it&rsquo;s on my todo list.&rdquo; I thought
that perfectly embodied the right way to think about FOSS.</p>
<p>When applying this philosophy, you may occasionally have to deal with an
absentee maintainer or a big old pile of legacy spaghetti code. Fork it! Rewrite
it! These are tough marbles but they&rsquo;re the marbles you&rsquo;ve gotta deal with. It&rsquo;s
not as hard as it looks.</p>
<p>The entire world of free software is your oyster. Nothing is off-limits: if it&rsquo;s
FOSS, you can work on it. Try not to be intimidated by unknown programming
languages, unfamiliar codebases, or a lack of time. You&rsquo;ll pick up the new
language sooner than you think<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, all projects are similar enough when you get
down to it, and small amounts of work done infrequently adds up over a long
enough time period.  FOSS doesn&rsquo;t have to move quickly, it just has to keep
moving. The Dawn spacecraft accelerated at 0.003 cm/s<sup>2</sup> and made it to
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/PIA19547-Ceres-DwarfPlanet-Dawn-RC3-AnimationFrame25-20150504.jpg">another world</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
