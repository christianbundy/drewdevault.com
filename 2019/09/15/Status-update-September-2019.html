    <p>Finally home again after a long series of travels! I spent almost a month in
Japan, then visited my sister&rsquo;s new home in Hawaii on the way eastwards, then
some old friends in Seattle, and finally after 5½ long weeks, it&rsquo;s home sweet
home here in Philadelphia. At least until I leave for
<a href="https://xdc2019.x.org/">XDC</a> in Montreal 2 weeks from now. Someday I&rsquo;ll have
some rest&hellip; throughout all of these wild travels, I&rsquo;ve been hard at work on my
free software projects. Let&rsquo;s get started with this month&rsquo;s status update!</p>

<p>First, Wayland news. I&rsquo;m happy to share with you that the Wayland book is now
more than halfway complete, and I&rsquo;ve made the drafts available online for a
discounted price: <a href="https://wayland-book.com">The Wayland Protocol</a>. Thanks to
all of my collaborators and readers who volunteered to provide feedback! There&rsquo;s
more Wayland-related news still, as this month marked the release of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/sway/releases/tag/1.2">sway
1.2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/releases/tag/0.7.0">wlroots 0.7.0</a>. I like this release
because it&rsquo;s light on new features - showing that sway is maturing into a stable
and reliable Wayland desktop. The features which were added are subtle and serve
to improve sway&rsquo;s status as a member of the broader ecosystem - sway 1.2
supports the new <a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-panel/pull/991">layer shell support in the MATE panel</a>, and the
same improvements are already helping with the development of other software.</p>
<p><a href="https://sr.ht/9Oro.png"><img src="https://sr.ht/9Oro.png" alt="Screenshot of MATE panel running on sway"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <small>Rest assured, the weird alignment issues were fixed</small>
</p>
<p>On the topic of <a href="https://aerc-mail.org">aerc</a>, I still haven&rsquo;t gotten around to
that write-up responding to <a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2019/08/14/patch-workflow-with-mutt-2019/">Greg KH&rsquo;s post</a>&hellip; but I will. Travels have
made it difficult to sit down for a while and do some serious long-term project
planning. Regardless, the current plans have still been being executed well.
Notmuch support continues to improve thanks to Reto Brunner&rsquo;s help, completions
are improving throughout, and heaps of little features - signatures, unread
message counts, :prompt, forward-as-attachment - are now supported.</p>
<p>I also spent some time this month working on Simon Ser&rsquo;s
<a href="https://mrsh.sh">mrsh</a>. I cleaned up call frames, implemented the <code>return</code>
builtin, finished the <code>pwd</code> builtin, improved readline support, fleshed out job
control, and made many other small improvements. With mrsh nearing completion,
I&rsquo;ve started up another project: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/ctools">ctools</a>. This provides the rest of the
POSIX commands required of a standard scripting environment (it replaces
coreutils or busybox). I&rsquo;m taking this one pretty seriously from the start -
every command has full POSIX.1-2017 support with a conformance test and a man
page, in one C source file and no dependencies. If you&rsquo;re looking for a good
afternoon project (or weekend, for some utilities), how about picking up your
favorite <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">POSIX</a> tool and
sending along an implementation?</p>
<p><a href="https://builds.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/job/88955"><img src="https://sr.ht/DSxS.png" alt="Screenshot of ctools test suite"></a></p>
<p>With these projects, along with ~mcf&rsquo;s <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~mcf/cproc">cproc</a>,
we&rsquo;re starting to see a simple and elegant operating system come together -
exactly the kind I wish we already had. To track our progress towards this goal,
I&rsquo;ve put up <a href="https://arewesimpleyet.org">arewesimpleyet.org</a>. A day may soon
come when computers become the again elegant and simple tools they were always
meant to be! At least if we assume &ldquo;within a few decades&rdquo; as a valid definition
of &ldquo;soon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To cover SourceHut news briefly: we hit 10,000 users this month! And it&rsquo;s
continued to grow since, up to 10,649 users at the time of writing. On the
subject of feature development, with Denis Laxalde&rsquo;s help we&rsquo;re starting to put
together a Debian repository for installing the services on Debian hosts. On
todo.sr.ht, users without accounts can now create and comment on tickets via
email. I also redesigned <a href="https://sourcehut.org">sourcehut.org</a>, adding a blog
with a greater breadth of topics than we&rsquo;ll see on the sr.ht-announce mailing
list.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for this month! I enjoyed my vacation and some much needed time away
from work&hellip; though for me a &ldquo;day off&rdquo; is a day where I write less than 1,000
lines of code. Thank you again for your support - it means the world to me. I&rsquo;ll
see you next month!</p>
