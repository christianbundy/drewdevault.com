    <p>Spring is here, and I&rsquo;m already miserable in the heat. Crazy weather here in
Philadelphia - I was woken up at 3 AM by my phone buzzing, telling me to take
immediate shelter from a tornado. But with my A/C cranked up and the tornado
safely passed, I&rsquo;ve been able to get a lot of work done.</p>
<p>The project with the most impressive progress is
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc2">aerc2</a>. It can now read emails, including
filtering them through arbitrary commands for highlighting diffs or coloring
quotes, or even rendering HTML email with a TUI browser like w3m.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another demo focusing on the embedded terminal emulator which makes this
possible:</p>

></script>
<p>Keybindings are also working, which are configured simiarly to vim - each
keybinding simulates a series of keystrokes, which all eventually boil down to
an ex-style command. I&rsquo;ve bought a domain for aerc, and I&rsquo;ll be populating it
with some marketing content and a nice tour of the features soon. I hope to have
time to work on sending emails this month as well. In the immediate future, I
need to fix some crashiness that occurs in some situations.</p>
<p>In other email-related news, <a href="https://git-send-email.io">git-send-email.io</a> is
now live, an interactive tutorial on using email with git. This workflow is the
one sourcehut focuses on, and is also used by a large number of important free
software projects, like Linux, gcc, clang, glibc, musl, ffmpeg, vim, emacs,
coreutils&hellip; and many, many more. Check it out!</p>
<p>I also spent a fair bit of time working on lists.sr.ht this month. Alpine Linux
has provisioned some infrastructure for a likely migration from their current
mailing list solution (mlmmj+hypermail) to one based on lists.sr.ht, which I
deployed a lists.sr.ht instance to for them, and trained them on some
administrative aspects of lists.sr.ht. User-facing improvments that came from
this work include tools for importing and exporting mail spools from lists,
better access controls, moderation tools, and per-list mime whitelisting and
blacklisting. Admin-facing tools include support for a wider variety of MTA
configurations and redirects to continue supporting old incoming mail addresses
when migrating from another mailing list system.</p>
<p>Stepping outside the realm of email, let&rsquo;s talk about Wayland. Since Sway 1.0,
development has continued at a modest pace, fixing a variety of small bugs and
further improving i3 compatibility. We&rsquo;re getting ready to split swaybg into a
standalone project which can be used on other Wayland compositors soon, too. I
also have been working more on Godot, and have switched gears towards adding a
Wayland backend to Godot upstream - so you can play Godot-based video games on
Wayland. I&rsquo;m still working with upstream and some other interested contributors
on the best way to integrate these changes upstream, but I more or less
completed a working port with support for nearly all of Godot&rsquo;s platform
abstractions.</p>
<p><a href="https://sr.ht/fOvB.png"><img src="https://sr.ht/fOvB.png" alt="Godot editor running on Wayland with HiDPI support"></a></p>
<p>In smaller project news, I spent an afternoon putting together a home-grown
video livestreaming platform a few weeks ago. The result:
<a href="https://live.drewdevault.com">live.drewdevault.com</a>. Once upon a time I was
livestreaming programming sessions on Twitch.tv, and in the future I&rsquo;d like to
do this more often on my new platform. This one is open source and built on the
shoulders of free software tools. I announce new streams on
<a href="https://cmpwn.com/@sir">Mastodon</a>, join us for the next one!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also starting on another project called cozy, which is yak-shaving for
several other projects I have in mind. It&rsquo;s kind of ambitious&hellip; it&rsquo;s a full
end-to-end C compiler toolchain. One of my goals (which, when completed, can
unblock other tasks before cozy as a whole is done) is to make the parser work
as a standalone library for reading, writing, and maniuplating the C AST. I&rsquo;ve
completed the lexer and basic yacc grammar, and I&rsquo;m working on extracting an AST
from the parser. I only started this weekend, so it&rsquo;s pretty early on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a fun weekend project I did shortly after the last update:
<a href="https://qlock.drewdevault.com/">otaqlock</a>. The server this runs on isn&rsquo;t awash
with bandwidth and the site doesn&rsquo;t work great on mobile - so your milage may
vary - but it is a cool artsy restoration project nonetheless. Until next time,
and thank you for your support!</p>
