    <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Holy shit! This is the phone I have always wanted. I have never been
this excited about the mobile sector before. However: the software side is
totally absent — phone calls are very dubious, SMS is somewhat dubious,
LTE requires some hacks, and everything will have to be written from the ground
up.</p>
<p>I have a PinePhone developer edition model, which I paid for out of pocket<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
and which took an excruciatingly long time to arrive. When it finally arrived,
it came with no SIM or microSD card (expected), and the eMMC had some half-assed
version of Android on it which just boot looped without POSTing to anything
useful<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This didn&rsquo;t bother me in the slightest — like any other
computer I&rsquo;ve purchased, I planned on immediately flashing my own OS on it. My
Linux distribution of choice for it is
<a href="https://postmarketos.org/">postmarketOS</a>, which is basically the mobile OS I&rsquo;d
build if I wanted to build a mobile OS.</p>
<p>Let me make this clear: <strong>right now, there are very few people, perhaps only
dozens, for whom this phone is the right phone, given the current level of
software support</strong>. I am not using it as my daily driver, and I won&rsquo;t for some
time. The only kind of person I would recommend this phone to is a developer who
believes in the phone and wants to help build the software necessary for it to
work.  However, it seems to me that all of the right people <em>are</em> working on the
software end of this phone — everyone I&rsquo;d expect from the pmOS community,
from KDE, from the kernel hackers — this phone has an unprecedented level
of community support and the software <em>will</em> be written.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s it actually like?</p>
<details>
  <summary>Expand for a summary of the specs</summary>
  <p>
    The device is about
    <abbr title="The thickness of a GameBoy cartridge">1 cm thick</abbr>
    and weighs
    <abbr
      title="The weight of one GameBoy Color, with batteries, without cartridge"
    >188 grams</abbr>. The screen is about 16 cm tall, of which 1.5 cm is bezel,
    and <abbr
      title="About the width and height of a GameBoy color, plus 1 inch of height"
    >7.5 cm wide</abbr> (5 mm of bezel). The physical size and weight is very
    similar to my daily driver, a Samsung Galaxy J7 Refine. It has a USB-C port,
    which I understand can be reconfigured for DisplayPort, and a standard
    headphone jack and speakers, both of which sound fine in my experience. The
    screen is 720x1440, and looks about as nice as any other phone. It has
    front- and back-facing cameras, which I've yet to get working (I understand
    that someone has got them working at some point), plus a flash/lamp on the
    back, and an <abbr
      title="Note that the only values for R, G, and B that I've managed to get working are 0.0 and 1.0 each, for a total of 7 possible colors (including off)"
    >RGB LED</abbr> on the front.
  </p>
  <p>
    The eMMC is 16G and, side note, had <em>seventeen</em> partitions on it when
    I first got the phone. 2G of RAM, 4 cores. It's not very powerful, but in my
    experience it runs lightweight UIs (such as <a
    href="https://swaywm.org">sway</a>) just fine. With very little effort by
    way of power management, and with obvious power sinks left unfixed, the
    battery lasts about 5 hours.
  </p>
</details>
<p>In short, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with it, but I&rsquo;ve never had especially strenuous
demands of my phone. I haven&rsquo;t run any benchmarks on the GPU, but it seems
reasonably fast and the open-source Lima driver supports GLESv2. The modem is
supported by <a href="https://01.org/ofono">Ofono</a>, which is a telephony daemon based on
dbus — however, I understand that we can just open <code>/dev/ttyUSB1</code> and talk
to the modem ourselves, and I may just write a program that does this. Using
Ofono, I have successfully spun up LTE internet, sent and received SMS messages,
and placed and answered phone calls - though the last one without working
audio. A friend from KDE, Bhushan Shah, is working on this and rumor has it that
a call has successfully been placed. I have not had success with MMS, but I
think it&rsquo;s possible. WiFi works. All of this with zero blobs and a kernel which
is&hellip; admittedly, pretty heavily patched, but <a href="https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/linux">open
source</a> and making its way upstream.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, no one wants to place phone calls by typing a lengthy command into
their terminal, but that these features can be done in an annoying way means
that it&rsquo;s feasible to write applications that do this in a convenient way. For
my part, I have been working on some components of a mobile-friendly Wayland
compositor, based on Sway, which I&rsquo;m calling Sway Mobile for the time being. I&rsquo;m
not sure if Sway will actually stick around once it becomes difficult to bend to
my will (it&rsquo;s designed for keyboard-driven operation, after all), but I&rsquo;m
building mobile shell components which will translate nicely to any other
wlroots-based compositors.</p>
<p>The first of these is a simple app drawer, which I&rsquo;ve dubbed
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/casa">casa</a>. I have a lot more stuff planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new bar/notification drawer/quick action thing</li>
<li>A dialer &amp; call manager, maybe integrated with gnome-contacts</li>
<li>A telephony daemon which records incoming SMS messages and pulls up the call
manager for incoming phone calls. Idea: write incoming SMS messages into a
Maildir.</li>
<li>A new touch-friendly Wayland lock screen</li>
<li>An on-screen keyboard program</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video showing casa in action:</p>

<p>The latest version has 4 columns and uses the space a bit better. Also, in the
course of this work I put together the
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ddevault/fdicons">fdicons</a> library, which may be
useful to some.</p>
<p>I have all sorts of other small things to work on, like making audio behave
better and improving power management. I intend to contribute these tools to
postmarketOS upstream as a nice lightweight plug-and-play UI package you can
choose from when installing pmOS, either improving their existing
postmarketos-ui-sway meta-package or making something new.</p>
<p>In conclusion: I have been waiting for this phone for years and years and years.
I have been hoping that someone would make a phone whose hardware was compatible
with upstream Linux drivers, and could <em>theoretically</em> be used as a daily driver
if only the software were up to snuff. I wanted this because I knew that the
free software community was totally capable of building the software for such a
phone, if only the hardware existed. This is actually happening — all of
the free software people I would hope are working on the PinePhone, are working
on the PinePhone. And it&rsquo;s only $150! I could buy four of them for the price of
the typical smartphone! And I just might!</p>
