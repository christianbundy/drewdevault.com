    <p>I have an HTC One, with CyanogenMod installed. I usually use Spotify, but I&rsquo;ve been wanting to move away from it for a while.
The biggest thing keeping me there was the ease of syncing up with my phone - I added music on my PC and it just showed up
on my phone.</p>
<p>So, I finally decided to make it work on my phone without Spotify. You might have success if you aren&rsquo;t using CyanogenMod,
but you definitely need to be rooted and you need to access a root shell on your phone. I was using <code>adb shell</code> to start with,
but it has poor terminal emulation. Instead, I ended up installing an SSH daemon on the phone and just using that. Easier to
use vim in such an enviornment.</p>
<p>The end result is that a cronjob kicks off each hour on my phone and runs a script that uses rsync to sync up my phone&rsquo;s music
with my desktop&rsquo;s music. That&rsquo;s another thing - a prerequisite of this working is that you have to expose your music to the
outside world on an SSH server somewhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you how I got it working, then you can see if it works for you. It might take some effort on your part to tweak
these instructions to fit your requirements.</p>
<h2 id="sanity-checks">Sanity checks</h2>
<p>Get into your phone&rsquo;s shell and make sure you have basic things installed. You&rsquo;ll need to make sure you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>bash</li>
<li>cron</li>
<li>ssh</li>
<li>rsync</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have them, you can probably get them by installing busybox.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ssh">Setting up SSH</h2>
<p>We need to generate a key. I tried using ssh-keygen before, but it had problems with rsync on Android. Instead, we use
dropbearkey. Generate your key with <code>dropbearkey -t rsa -f /data/.ssh/id_rsa</code>. You&rsquo;ll see the public key echoed to stdout.
It&rsquo;s not saved anywhere for you, so grab it out of your shell and put it somewhere - namely, in the authorized_keys file
on the SSH server you plan to pull music from.</p>
<p>At this point, you can probably SSH into the server you want to pull from. Run <code>ssh -i /data/.ssh/id_rsa &lt;your server here&gt;</code>
to double check. Note that this isn&rsquo;t just for fun - you need to do this to get your server into known_hosts, so we can
non-interactively access it.</p>
<h2 id="making-android-more-sane">Making Android more sane</h2>
<p>Now that this is working, we need to clean up a little before cron will run right. Android is only a &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; system in the
sense that <code>uname</code> outputs &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. It grossly ignores the FHS and you need to fix it a little. Figure out how to do a
nice init.d script on your phone. For my CyanogenMod install, I can add scripts to <code>/data/local/userlocal.d/</code> and they&rsquo;ll
be run at boot. Here&rsquo;s my little script for making Android a little more sane:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="cp">#!/system/bin/sh
</span><span class="cp"></span><span class="c1"># Making /system rw isn&#39;t strictly needed</span>
mount -o remount,rw /system
mount -o remount,rw /
ln -s /data/var /var
ln -s /system/bin /bin
ln -s /data/.ssh /.ssh
crond
</code></pre></div><h2 id="update-script-and-initial-import">Update script and initial import</h2>
<p>The following is the script we&rsquo;ll use to update your phone&rsquo;s music library.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="cp">#!/system/xbin/bash
</span><span class="cp"></span><span class="c1"># Syncs music between a remote computer and this phone</span>

<span class="k">fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Save this script to <code>/data/updateMusic</code>, make it executable with <code>chmod +x /data/updateMusic</code>, then run the initial import
with <code>/data/updateMusic</code>. After a while, you&rsquo;ll have all your computer&rsquo;s music on your phone. Now, we just need to make it
update automatically.</p>
<p>Note: I set up a couple of logs for you. <code>/var/log/update-music.log</code> has the timestamp of every time it did an update. Also,
<code>/var/log/update-music-rsync-so.log</code> has the output of rsync from each run.</p>
<h2 id="cron">Cron</h2>
<p>Finally, we need to set up a cronjob. If you followed the instructions so far (and if you&rsquo;re lucky), you should have everything
ready for cron. The biggest pain in my ass was getting cron to coorperate, but the init script earlier should take care of
that. Run <code>crontab -e</code> and write your crontab:</p>
<pre><code>0 * * * * /data/updateMusic
</code></pre>
<p>Nice and simple. Your phone will now sync up your music every hour, on the hour, with your home computer. Here are some
possible points for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check wlan0 and only sync if it&rsquo;s up</li>
<li>Log cron somewhere</li>
<li>Alter the update script to do a little bit better about the &ldquo;fallback&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sync more than just music</li>
</ul>
<p>After all of this, I now have a nice setup that syncs music to my phone so I can listen to it with Apollo. I might switch
away from Apollo, though, it&rsquo;s pretty buggy. <a href="mailto:sir@cmpwn.com">Let me know</a> if you can suggest an alternative music
player, or if you get stuck working through this procedure yourself.</p>
